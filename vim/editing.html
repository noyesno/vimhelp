</pre><hr/><pre>1. Introduction						<b class="vimtag">*<a name="edit-intro">edit-intro</a>*</b>

Editing a file with Vim means:

1. reading the file into a buffer
2. changing the buffer with editor commands
3. writing the buffer into a file

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="current-file">current-file</a>*</b>
As long as you don't write the buffer, the original file remains unchanged.
If you start editing a file (read a file into the buffer), the file name is
remembered as the "current file name".  This is also known as the name of the
current buffer.  It can be used with "%" on the command line |<a href="cmdline.html#:_%">:_%</a>|.

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="alternate-file">alternate-file</a>*</b>
If there already was a current file name, then that one becomes the alternate
file name.  It can be used with "#" on the command line |<a href="cmdline.html#:_%23">:_#</a>| and you can use
the |<a href="editing.html#CTRL-^">CTRL-^</a>| command to toggle between the current and the alternate file.
However, the alternate file name is not changed when |<a href="editing.html#:keepalt">:keepalt</a>| is used.
An alternate file name is remembered for each window.

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name=":keepalt">:keepalt</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name=":keepa">:keepa</a>*</b>
:keepalt <code class="special">{cmd}</code>		Execute <code class="special">{cmd}</code> while keeping the current alternate file
			name.  <code class="note">Note</code> that commands invoked indirectly (e.g.,
			with a function) may still set the alternate file
			name.

All file names are remembered in the buffer list.  When you enter a file name,
for editing (e.g., with ":e filename") or writing (e.g., with ":w filename"),
the file name is added to the list.  You can use the buffer list to remember
which files you edited and to quickly switch from one file to another (e.g.,
to copy text) with the |<a href="editing.html#CTRL-^">CTRL-^</a>| command.  First type the number of the file
and then hit CTRL-^.


<code class="keystroke">CTRL-G</code>		or				<b class="vimtag">*<a name="CTRL-G">CTRL-G</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name=":f">:f</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name=":fi">:fi</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name=":file">:file</a>*</b>
:f[ile]			Prints the current file name (as typed, unless ":cd"
			was used), the cursor position (unless the 'ruler'
			option is set), and the file status (readonly,
			modified, read errors, new file).  See the 'shortmess'
			option about how to make this message shorter.

:f[ile]!		like |<a href="editing.html#:file">:file</a>|, but don't truncate the name even when
			'shortmess' indicates this.

<code class="special">{count}</code><code class="keystroke">CTRL-G</code>		Like <code class="keystroke">CTRL-G</code>, but prints the current file name with
			full path.  If the count is higher than 1 the current
			buffer number is also given.

					<b class="vimtag">*<a name="g_CTRL-G">g_CTRL-G</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="word-count">word-count</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="byte-count">byte-count</a>*</b>
g <code class="keystroke">CTRL-G</code>		Prints the current position of the cursor in five
			ways: Column, Line, Word, Character and Byte.  If the
			number of Characters and Bytes is the same then the
			Character position is omitted.
			If there are characters in the line that take more
			than one position on the screen (<code class="special">&lt;Tab&gt;</code> or special
			character), both the "real" column and the screen
			column are shown, separated with a dash.
			Also see the 'ruler' option and the |<a href="eval.html#wordcount()">wordcount()</a>|
			function.

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="v_g_CTRL-G">v_g_CTRL-G</a>*</b>
<code class="special">{Visual}</code>g <code class="keystroke">CTRL-G</code>	Similar to "g <code class="keystroke">CTRL-G</code>", but Word, Character, Line, and
			Byte counts for the visually selected region are
			displayed.
			In Blockwise mode, Column count is also shown.  (For
			<code class="special">{Visual}</code> see |<a href="visual.html#Visual-mode">Visual-mode</a>|.)

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name=":file_f">:file_f</a>*</b>
:f[ile][!] <code class="special">{name}</code>	Sets the current file name to <code class="special">{name}</code>.  The optional !
			avoids truncating the message, as with |<a href="editing.html#:file">:file</a>|.
			If the buffer did have a name, that name becomes the
			|<a href="editing.html#alternate-file">alternate-file</a>| name.  An unlisted buffer is created
			to hold the old name.
							<b class="vimtag">*<a name=":0file">:0file</a>*</b>
:0f[ile][!]		Remove the name of the current buffer.  The optional !
			avoids truncating the message, as with |<a href="editing.html#:file">:file</a>|.

:buffers
:files
:ls			List all the currently known file names.  See
			|<a href="windows.html#windows.txt">windows</a>| |<a href="windows.html#:files">:files</a>| |<a href="windows.html#:buffers">:buffers</a>| |<a href="windows.html#:ls">:ls</a>|.

Vim will remember the full path name of a file name that you enter.  In most
cases when the file name is displayed only the name you typed is shown, but
the full path name is being used if you used the ":cd" command |<a href="editing.html#:cd">:cd</a>|.

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="home-replace">home-replace</a>*</b>
If the environment variable $HOME is set, and the file name starts with that
string, it is often displayed with HOME replaced with "~".  This was done to
keep file names short.  When reading or writing files the full name is still
used, the "~" is only used when displaying file names.  When replacing the
file name would result in just "~", "~/" is used instead (to avoid confusion
between options set to $HOME with 'backupext' set to "~").

When writing the buffer, the default is to use the current file name.  Thus
when you give the "ZZ" or ":wq" command, the original file will be
overwritten.  If you do not want this, the buffer can be written into another
file by giving a file name argument to the ":write" command.  For example:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	vim testfile</code>
<code class="example">	[change the buffer with editor commands]</code>
<code class="example">	:w newfile</code>
<code class="example">	:q</code>
<code class="example"></code>
This will create a file "newfile", that is a modified copy of "testfile".
The file "testfile" will remain unchanged.  Anyway, if the 'backup' option is
set, Vim renames or copies the original file before it will be overwritten.
You can use this file if you discover that you need the original file.  See
also the 'patchmode' option.  The name of the backup file is normally the same
as the original file with 'backupext' appended.  The default "~" is a bit
strange to avoid accidentally overwriting existing files.  If you prefer ".bak"
change the 'backupext' option.  Extra dots are replaced with '_' on MS-Windows
machines, when Vim has detected that an MS-DOS-like filesystem is being used
(e.g., messydos or crossdos) or when the 'shortname' option is on.  The
backup file can be placed in another directory by setting 'backupdir'.

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="auto-shortname">auto-shortname</a>*</b>
Technical: On the Amiga you can use 30 characters for a file name.  But on an
	   MS-DOS-compatible filesystem only 8 plus 3 characters are
	   available.  Vim tries to detect the type of filesystem when it is
	   creating the .swp file.  If an MS-DOS-like filesystem is suspected,
	   a flag is set that has the same effect as setting the 'shortname'
	   option.  This flag will be reset as soon as you start editing a
	   new file.  The flag will be used when making the file name for the
	   ".swp" and ".~" files for the current file.  But when you are
	   editing a file in a normal filesystem and write to an MS-DOS-like
	   filesystem the flag will not have been set.  In that case the
	   creation of the ".~" file may fail and you will get an error
	   message.  Use the 'shortname' option in this case.

When you started editing without giving a file name, "No File" is displayed in
messages.  If the ":write" command is used with a file name argument, the file
name for the current file is set to that file name.  This only happens when
the 'F' flag is included in 'cpoptions' (by default it is included) |<a href="options.html#cpo-F">cpo-F</a>|.
This is useful when entering text in an empty buffer and then writing it to a
file.  If 'cpoptions' contains the 'f' flag (by default it is NOT included)
|<a href="options.html#cpo-f">cpo-f</a>| the file name is set for the ":read file" command.  This is useful
when starting Vim without an argument and then doing ":read file" to start
editing a file.
When the file name was set and 'filetype' is empty the filetype detection
autocommands will be triggered.
							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="not-edited">not-edited</a>*</b>
Because the file name was set without really starting to edit that file, you
are protected from overwriting that file.  This is done by setting the
"<code class="note">note</code>dited" flag.  You can see if this flag is set with the <code class="keystroke">CTRL-G</code> or ":file"
command.  It will include "[Not edited]" when the "<code class="note">note</code>dited" flag is set.
When writing the buffer to the current file name (with ":w!"), the "<code class="note">note</code>dited"
flag is reset.

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="abandon">abandon</a>*</b>
Vim remembers whether you have changed the buffer.  You are protected from
losing the changes you made.  If you try to quit without writing, or want to
start editing another file, Vim will refuse this.  In order to overrule this
protection, add a '!' to the command.  The changes will then be lost.  For
example: ":q" will not work if the buffer was changed, but ":q!" will.  To see
whether the buffer was changed use the "<code class="keystroke">CTRL-G</code>" command.  The message includes
the string "[Modified]" if the buffer has been changed, or "+" if the 'm' flag
is in 'shortmess'.

If you want to automatically save the changes without asking, switch on the
'autowriteall' option.  'autowrite' is the associated Vi-compatible option
that does not work for all commands.

If you want to keep the changed buffer without saving it, switch on the
'hidden' option.  See |<a href="windows.html#hidden-buffer">hidden-buffer</a>|.  Some commands work like this even when
'hidden' is not set, check the help for the command.

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name=":e">:e</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name=":edit">:edit</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="reload">reload</a>*</b>
:e[dit] [++opt] [+cmd]	Edit the current file.  This is useful to re-edit the

			This fails when changes have been made to the current
			buffer and 'autowriteall' isn't set or the file can't
			be written.
			Also see |<a href="editing.html#++opt">++opt</a>| and |<a href="editing.html#+cmd">+cmd</a>|.

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name=":edit!">:edit!</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="discard">discard</a>*</b>
:e[dit]! [++opt] [+cmd]
			Edit the current file always.  Discard any changes to
			the current buffer.  This is useful if you want to
			start all over again.
			Also see |<a href="editing.html#++opt">++opt</a>| and |<a href="editing.html#+cmd">+cmd</a>|.

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name=":edit_f">:edit_f</a>*</b>
:e[dit] [++opt] [+cmd] <code class="special">{file}</code>
			Edit <code class="special">{file}</code>.
			This fails when changes have been made to the current

			set and the file can be written.
			Also see |<a href="editing.html#++opt">++opt</a>| and |<a href="editing.html#+cmd">+cmd</a>|.

			Also see |<a href="editing.html#++opt">++opt</a>| and |<a href="editing.html#+cmd">+cmd</a>|.

:e[dit] [++opt] [+cmd] #<code class="special">[count]</code>
			Edit the <code class="special">[count]</code>th buffer (as shown by |<a href="windows.html#:files">:files</a>|).
			This command does the same as <code class="special">[count]</code> CTRL-^.  But ":e
			#" doesn't work if the alternate buffer doesn't have a
			file name, while CTRL-^ still works then.
			Also see |<a href="editing.html#++opt">++opt</a>| and |<a href="editing.html#+cmd">+cmd</a>|.

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name=":ene">:ene</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name=":enew">:enew</a>*</b>
:ene[w]			Edit a new, unnamed buffer.  This fails when changes
			have been made to the current buffer, unless 'hidden'
			is set or 'autowriteall' is set and the file can be
			written.
			If 'fileformats' is not empty, the first format given
			will be used for the new buffer.  If 'fileformats' is
			empty, the 'fileformat' of the current buffer is used.

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name=":ene!">:ene!</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name=":enew!">:enew!</a>*</b>
:ene[w]!		Edit a new, unnamed buffer.  Discard any changes to
			the current buffer.
			Set 'fileformat' like |<a href="editing.html#:enew">:enew</a>|.

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name=":fin">:fin</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name=":find">:find</a>*</b>
:fin[d][!] [++opt] [+cmd] <code class="special">{file}</code>
			Find <code class="special">{file}</code> in 'path' and then |<a href="editing.html#:edit">:edit</a>| it.
			{not available when the |<a href="various.html#+file_in_path">+file_in_path</a>| feature was
			disabled at compile time}

:<code class="special">{count}</code>fin[d][!] [++opt] [+cmd] <code class="special">{file}</code>
			Just like ":find", but use the <code class="special">{count}</code> match in
			'path'.  Thus ":2find file" will find the second
			"file" found in 'path'.  When there are fewer matches
			for the file in 'path' than asked for, you get an
			error message.

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name=":ex">:ex</a>*</b>
:ex [++opt] [+cmd] [file]
			Same as |<a href="editing.html#:edit">:edit</a>|.

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name=":vi">:vi</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name=":visual">:visual</a>*</b>
:vi[sual][!] [++opt] [+cmd] [file]
			When used in Ex mode: Leave |<a href="intro.html#Ex-mode">Ex-mode</a>|, go back to
			Normal mode.  Otherwise same as |<a href="editing.html#:edit">:edit</a>|.

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name=":vie">:vie</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name=":view">:view</a>*</b>
:vie[w][!] [++opt] [+cmd] file
			When used in Ex mode: Leave |<a href="intro.html#Ex-mode">Ex-mode</a>|, go back to
			Normal mode.  Otherwise same as |<a href="editing.html#:edit">:edit</a>|, but set
			'readonly' option for this buffer.

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="CTRL-^">CTRL-^</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="CTRL-6">CTRL-6</a>*</b>
CTRL-^			Edit the alternate file.  Mostly the alternate file is
			the previously edited file.  This is a quick way to
			toggle between two files.  It is equivalent to ":e #",
			except that it also works when there is no file name.

			If the 'autowrite' or 'autowriteall' option is on and
			the buffer was changed, write it.
			Mostly the ^ character is positioned on the 6 key,
			pressing CTRL and 6 then gets you what we call CTRL-^.
			But on some non-US keyboards CTRL-^ is produced in
			another way.

<code class="special">{count}</code>CTRL-^		Edit <code class="special">[count]</code>th file in the buffer list (equivalent to
			":e #<code class="special">[count]</code>").  This is a quick way to switch between
			files.
			See |<a href="editing.html#CTRL-^">CTRL-^</a>| above for further details.

<code class="special">[count]</code>]f						<b class="vimtag">*<a name="]f">]f</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="[f">[f</a>*</b>
<code class="special">[count]</code>[f		Same as "gf".  Deprecated.

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="gf">gf</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="E446">E446</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="E447">E447</a>*</b>
<code class="special">[count]</code>gf		Edit the file whose name is under or after the cursor.
			Mnemonic: "goto file".
			Uses the 'isfname' option to find out which characters
			are supposed to be in a file name.  Trailing
			punctuation characters ".,:;!" are ignored. Escaped
			spaces "\ " are reduced to a single space.
			Uses the 'path' option as a list of directory names to
			look for the file.  See the 'path' option for details
			about relative directories and wildcards.
			Uses the 'suffixesadd' option to check for file names
			with a suffix added.
			If the file can't be found, 'includeexpr' is used to
			modify the name and another attempt is done.
			If a <code class="special">[count]</code> is given, the count'th file that is found
			in the 'path' is edited.
			This command fails if Vim refuses to |<a href="editing.html#abandon">abandon</a>| the
			current file.
			If you want to edit the file in a new window use
			|<a href="windows.html#CTRL-W_CTRL-F">CTRL-W_CTRL-F</a>|.
			If you do want to edit a new file, use:
<code class="example">				:e <code class="special">&lt;cfile&gt;</code></code>
&lt;			To make gf always work like that:
<code class="example">				:map gf :e <code class="special">&lt;cfile&gt;</code><code class="special">&lt;CR&gt;</code></code>
			If the name is a hypertext link, that looks like
			"type://machine/path", you need the |<a href="pi_netrw.html#netrw">netrw</a>| plugin.
			For Unix the '~' character is expanded, like in
			"~user/file".  Environment variables are expanded too
			|<a href="options.html#expand-env">expand-env</a>|.
			{not available when the |<a href="various.html#+file_in_path">+file_in_path</a>| feature was
			disabled at compile time}

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="v_gf">v_gf</a>*</b>
<code class="special">{Visual}</code><code class="special">[count]</code>gf	Same as "gf", but the highlighted text is used as the
			name of the file to edit.  'isfname' is ignored.
			Leading blanks are skipped, otherwise all blanks and
			special characters are included in the file name.
			(For <code class="special">{Visual}</code> see |<a href="visual.html#Visual-mode">Visual-mode</a>|.)

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="gF">gF</a>*</b>
<code class="special">[count]</code>gF		Same as "gf", except if a number follows the file
			name, then the cursor is positioned on that line in
			the file.
			The file name and the number must be separated by a
			non-filename (see 'isfname') and non-numeric
			character. " line " is also recognized, like it is
			used in the output of `:verbose command UserCmd`
			White space between the filename, the separator and
			the number are ignored.
			Examples:
<code class="section">				eval.c:10 </code>
<code class="section">				eval.c @ 20 </code>
<code class="section">				eval.c (30) </code>
<code class="section">				eval.c 40 </code>

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="v_gF">v_gF</a>*</b>
<code class="special">{Visual}</code><code class="special">[count]</code>gF	Same as "v_gf".

These commands are used to start editing a single file.  This means that the
file is read into the buffer and the current file name is set.  The file that
is opened depends on the current directory, see |<a href="editing.html#:cd">:cd</a>|.

See |<a href="insert.html#read-messages">read-messages</a>| for an explanation of the message that is given after the
file has been read.

You can use the ":e!" command if you messed up the buffer and want to start
all over again.  The ":e" command is only useful if you have changed the
current file name.

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name=":filename">:filename</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="{file}">{file}</a>*</b>
Besides the things mentioned here, more special items for where a filename is
expected are mentioned at |<a href="cmdline.html#cmdline-special">cmdline-special</a>|.

<code class="note">Note</code> for systems other than Unix: When using a command that accepts a single
file name (like ":edit file") spaces in the file name are allowed, but
trailing spaces are ignored.  This is useful on systems that regularly embed
spaces in file names (like MS-Windows and the Amiga).  Example: The command
":e   Long File Name " will edit the file "Long File Name".  When using a
command that accepts more than one file name (like ":next file1 file2")
embedded spaces must be escaped with a backslash.

						<b class="vimtag">*<a name="wildcard">wildcard</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="wildcards">wildcards</a>*</b>
Wildcards in <code class="special">{file}</code> are expanded, but as with file completion, 'wildignore'
and 'suffixes' apply.  Which wildcards are supported depends on the system.
These are the common ones:
	?	matches one character
	*	matches anything, including nothing
	**	matches anything, including nothing, recurses into directories
	[abc]	match 'a', 'b' or 'c'

To avoid the special meaning of the wildcards prepend a backslash.  However,
on MS-Windows the backslash is a path separator and "path\[abc]" is still seen
as a wildcard when "[" is in the 'isfname' option.  A simple way to avoid this
is to use "path\[[]abc]", this matches the file "path\[abc]".

					<b class="vimtag">*<a name="starstar-wildcard">starstar-wildcard</a>*</b>
Expanding "**" is possible on Unix, Win32, Mac OS/X and a few other systems.
This allows searching a directory tree.  This goes up to 100 directories deep.
<code class="note">Note</code> there are some commands where this works slightly differently, see
|<a href="editing.html#file-searching">file-searching</a>|.
Example:
<code class="example">	:n *<b class="vimtag">*<a name="%2F">/</a>*</b>.txt</code>
Finds files:
<code class="section">	aaa.txt </code>
<code class="section">	subdir/bbb.txt </code>
<code class="section">	a/b/c/d/ccc.txt </code>
When non-wildcard characters are used right before or after "**" these are
only matched in the top directory.  They are not used for directories further
down in the tree. For example:
<code class="example">	:n /usr/inc**/types.h</code>
Finds files:
<code class="section">	/usr/include/types.h </code>
<code class="section">	/usr/include/sys/types.h </code>
<code class="section">	/usr/inc/old/types.h </code>
<code class="note">Note</code> that the path with "/sys" is included because it does not need to match
"/inc".  Thus it's like matching "/usr/inc<b class="vimtag">*<a name="%2F">/</a>*</b>/*...", not
"/usr/inc<b class="vimtag">*<a name="%2Finc">/inc</a>*</b>/inc*".

					<b class="vimtag">*<a name="backtick-expansion">backtick-expansion</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="`-expansion">`-expansion</a>*</b>
On Unix and a few other systems you can also use backticks for the file name
argument, for example:
<code class="example">	:next `find . -name ver\\*.c -print`</code>
<code class="example">	:view `ls -t *.patch  \| head -n1`</code>
Vim will run the command in backticks using the 'shell' and use the standard
output as argument for the given Vim command (error messages from the shell
command will be discarded).
To see what shell command Vim is running, set the 'verbose' option to 4. When
the shell command returns a non-zero exit code, an error message will be
displayed and the Vim command will be aborted. To avoid this make the shell
always return zero like so:
<code class="example">       :next `find . -name ver\\*.c -print \|<code class="badlink">\</code>| true`</code>
<code class="example"></code>
The backslashes before the star are required to prevent the shell from
expanding "ver*.c" prior to execution of the find program.  The backslash
before the shell pipe symbol "|" prevents Vim from parsing it as command
termination.
This also works for most other systems, with the restriction that the
backticks must be around the whole item.  It is not possible to have text
directly before the first or just after the last backtick.

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="`%20">`=</a>*</b>
You can have the backticks expanded as a Vim expression, instead of as an
external command, by putting an equal sign right after the first backtick,
e.g.:
<code class="example">	:e `=tempname()`</code>
The expression can contain just about anything, thus this can also be used to
avoid the special meaning of '"', '|', '%' and '#'.  However, 'wildignore'
does apply like to other wildcards.

Environment variables in the expression are expanded when evaluating the
expression, thus this works:
<code class="example">	:e `=$HOME . '/.vimrc'`</code>
This does not work, $HOME is inside a string and used literally:
<code class="example">	:e `='$HOME' . '/.vimrc'`</code>
<code class="example"></code>
If the expression returns a string then names are to be separated with line
breaks.  When the result is a |<a href="eval.html#List">List</a>| then each item is used as a name.  Line
breaks also separate names.
<code class="note">Note</code> that such expressions are only supported in places where a filename is
expected as an argument to an Ex-command.

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="++opt">++opt</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="[++opt]">[++opt]</a>*</b>
The [++opt] argument can be used to force the value of 'fileformat',
'fileencoding' or 'binary' to a value for one command, and to specify the
behavior for bad characters.  The form is:
<code class="example">	++<code class="special">{optname}</code></code>
Or:
<code class="example">	++<code class="special">{optname}</code>=<code class="special">{value}</code></code>
<code class="example"></code>
Where <code class="special">{optname}</code> is one of:	    <b class="vimtag">*<a name="++ff">++ff</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="++enc">++enc</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="++bin">++bin</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="++nobin">++nobin</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="++edit">++edit</a>*</b>
    ff     or  fileformat   overrides 'fileformat'
    enc    or  encoding	    overrides 'fileencoding'
    bin    or  binary	    sets 'binary'
    nobin  or  nobinary	    resets 'binary'
    bad			    specifies behavior for bad characters
    edit		    for |<a href="insert.html#:read">:read</a>| only: keep option values as if editing
			    a file

<code class="special">{value}</code> cannot contain white space.  It can be any valid value for these
options.  Examples:
<code class="example">	:e ++ff=unix</code>
This edits the same file again with 'fileformat' set to "unix".
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	:w ++enc=latin1 newfile</code>
This writes the current buffer to "newfile" in latin1 format.

There may be several ++opt arguments, separated by white space.  They must all
appear before any |<a href="editing.html#+cmd">+cmd</a>| argument.

								<b class="vimtag">*<a name="++bad">++bad</a>*</b>
The argument of "++bad=" specifies what happens with characters that can't be
converted and illegal bytes.  It can be one of three things:
    ++bad=X      A single-byte character that replaces each bad character.
    ++bad=keep   Keep bad characters without conversion.  <code class="note">Note</code> that this may
		 result in illegal bytes in your text!
    ++bad=drop   Remove the bad characters.

The default is like "++bad=?": Replace each bad character with a question
mark.  In some places an inverted question mark is used (0xBF).

<code class="note">Note</code> that not all commands use the ++bad argument, even though they do not
give an error when you add it.  E.g. |<a href="editing.html#:write">:write</a>|.

<code class="note">Note</code> that when reading, the 'fileformat' and 'fileencoding' options will be
set to the used format.  When writing this doesn't happen, thus a next write
will use the old value of the option.  Same for the 'binary' option.


							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="+cmd">+cmd</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="[+cmd]">[+cmd]</a>*</b>
The [+cmd] argument can be used to position the cursor in the newly opened
file, or execute any other command:
	+		Start at the last line.
	+<code class="special">{num}</code>		Start at line <code class="special">{num}</code>.
	+/<code class="special">{pat}</code>		Start at first line containing <code class="special">{pat}</code>.
	+<code class="special">{command}</code>	Execute <code class="special">{command}</code> after opening the new file.
			<code class="special">{command}</code> is any Ex command.
To include a white space in the <code class="special">{pat}</code> or <code class="special">{command}</code>, precede it with a
backslash.  Double the number of backslashes.
<code class="example">	:edit  +/The\ book	     file</code>
<code class="example">	:edit  +/dir\ dirname\\      file</code>
<code class="example">	:edit  +set\ dir=c:\\\\temp  file</code>
<code class="note">Note</code> that in the last example the number of backslashes is halved twice: Once
for the "+cmd" argument and once for the ":set" command.

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="file-formats">file-formats</a>*</b>
The 'fileformat' option sets the <code class="special">&lt;EOL&gt;</code> style for a file:
<code class="section">'fileformat'    characters	   name				</code>
  "dos"		<code class="special">&lt;CR&gt;</code><code class="special">&lt;NL&gt;</code> or <code class="special">&lt;NL&gt;</code>   DOS format		<b class="vimtag">*<a name="DOS-format">DOS-format</a>*</b>
  "unix"	<code class="special">&lt;NL&gt;</code>		   Unix format		<b class="vimtag">*<a name="Unix-format">Unix-format</a>*</b>
  "mac"		<code class="special">&lt;CR&gt;</code>		   Mac format		<b class="vimtag">*<a name="Mac-format">Mac-format</a>*</b>
Previously 'textmode' was used.  It is obsolete now.

When reading a file, the mentioned characters are interpreted as the <code class="special">&lt;EOL&gt;</code>.
In DOS format (default for Win32), <code class="special">&lt;CR&gt;</code><code class="special">&lt;NL&gt;</code> and <code class="special">&lt;NL&gt;</code> are both interpreted as
the <code class="special">&lt;EOL&gt;</code>.  <code class="note">Note</code> that when writing the file in DOS format, <code class="special">&lt;CR&gt;</code> characters
will be added for each single <code class="special">&lt;NL&gt;</code>.  Also see |<a href="insert.html#file-read">file-read</a>|.

When writing a file, the mentioned characters are used for <code class="special">&lt;EOL&gt;</code>.  For DOS
format <code class="special">&lt;CR&gt;</code><code class="special">&lt;NL&gt;</code> is used.  Also see |<a href="editing.html#DOS-format-write">DOS-format-write</a>|.

You can read a file in DOS format and write it in Unix format.  This will
replace all <code class="special">&lt;CR&gt;</code><code class="special">&lt;NL&gt;</code> pairs by <code class="special">&lt;NL&gt;</code> (assuming 'fileformats' includes "dos"):
<code class="example">	:e file</code>
<code class="example">	:set fileformat=unix</code>
<code class="example">	:w</code>
If you read a file in Unix format and write with DOS format, all <code class="special">&lt;NL&gt;</code>
characters will be replaced with <code class="special">&lt;CR&gt;</code><code class="special">&lt;NL&gt;</code> (assuming 'fileformats' includes
"unix"):
<code class="example">	:e file</code>
<code class="example">	:set fileformat=dos</code>
<code class="example">	:w</code>
<code class="example"></code>
If you start editing a new file and the 'fileformats' option is not empty
(which is the default), Vim will try to detect whether the lines in the file
are separated by the specified formats.  When set to "unix,dos", Vim will
check for lines with a single <code class="special">&lt;NL&gt;</code> (as used on Unix and Amiga) or by a <code class="special">&lt;CR&gt;</code>
<code class="special">&lt;NL&gt;</code> pair (MS-Windows).  Only when ALL lines end in <code class="special">&lt;CR&gt;</code><code class="special">&lt;NL&gt;</code>, 'fileformat' is
set to "dos", otherwise it is set to "unix".  When 'fileformats' includes
"mac", and no <code class="special">&lt;NL&gt;</code> characters are found in the file, 'fileformat' is set to
"mac".

If the 'fileformat' option is set to "dos" on non-MS-Windows systems the
message "[dos format]" is shown to remind you that something unusual is
happening.  On MS-Windows systems you get the message "[unix format]" if
'fileformat' is set to "unix".  On all systems but the Macintosh you get the
message "[mac format]" if 'fileformat' is set to "mac".

If the 'fileformats' option is empty and DOS format is used, but while reading
a file some lines did not end in <code class="special">&lt;CR&gt;</code><code class="special">&lt;NL&gt;</code>, "[CR missing]" will be included in
the file message.
If the 'fileformats' option is empty and Mac format is used, but while reading
a file a <code class="special">&lt;NL&gt;</code> was found, "[NL missing]" will be included in the file message.

If the new file does not exist, the 'fileformat' of the current buffer is used
when 'fileformats' is empty.  Otherwise the first format from 'fileformats' is
used for the new file.

Before editing binary, executable or Vim script files you should set the
'binary' option.  A simple way to do this is by starting Vim with the "-b"
option.  This will avoid the use of 'fileformat'.  Without this you risk that
single <code class="special">&lt;NL&gt;</code> characters are unexpectedly replaced with <code class="special">&lt;CR&gt;</code><code class="special">&lt;NL&gt;</code>.

You can encrypt files that are written by setting the 'key' option.  This
provides some security against others reading your files. |<a href="editing.html#encryption">encryption</a>|


</pre><hr/><pre>3. The argument list				<b class="vimtag">*<a name="argument-list">argument-list</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="arglist">arglist</a>*</b>

If you give more than one file name when starting Vim, this list is remembered
as the argument list.  You can jump to each file in this list.

Do not confuse this with the buffer list, which you can see with the
|<a href="windows.html#:buffers">:buffers</a>| command.  The argument list was already present in Vi, the buffer
list is new in Vim.  Every file name in the argument list will also be present
in the buffer list (unless it was deleted with |<a href="windows.html#:bdel">:bdel</a>| or |<a href="windows.html#:bwipe">:bwipe</a>|).  But it's
common that names in the buffer list are not in the argument list.

This subject is introduced in section |<a href="usr_07.html#07.2">07.2</a>| of the user manual.

There is one global argument list, which is used for all windows by default.
It is possible to create a new argument list local to a window, see
|<a href="editing.html#:arglocal">:arglocal</a>|.

You can use the argument list with the following commands, and with the
expression functions |<a href="eval.html#argc()">argc()</a>| and |<a href="eval.html#argv()">argv()</a>|.  These all work on the argument
list of the current window.

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name=":ar">:ar</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name=":arg">:arg</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name=":args">:args</a>*</b>
:ar[gs]			Print the argument list, with the current file in
			square brackets.

:ar[gs] [++opt] [+cmd] <code class="special">{arglist}</code>			<b class="vimtag">*<a name=":args_f">:args_f</a>*</b>
			Define <code class="special">{arglist}</code> as the new argument list and edit
			the first one.  This fails when changes have been made
			and Vim does not want to |<a href="editing.html#abandon">abandon</a>| the current buffer.
			Also see |<a href="editing.html#++opt">++opt</a>| and |<a href="editing.html#+cmd">+cmd</a>|.

:ar[gs]! [++opt] [+cmd] <code class="special">{arglist}</code>			<b class="vimtag">*<a name=":args_f!">:args_f!</a>*</b>
			Define <code class="special">{arglist}</code> as the new argument list and edit
			the first one.  Discard any changes to the current
			buffer.
			Also see |<a href="editing.html#++opt">++opt</a>| and |<a href="editing.html#+cmd">+cmd</a>|.

			Add <code class="special">{name}</code>s to the argument list and edit it.
			When <code class="special">{name}</code> already exists in the argument list, this
			entry is edited.
			This is like using |<a href="editing.html#:argadd">:argadd</a>| and then |<a href="editing.html#:edit">:edit</a>|.
			Spaces in filenames have to be escaped with "\".
			<code class="special">[count]</code> is used like with |<a href="editing.html#:argadd">:argadd</a>|.
			If the current file cannot be |<a href="editing.html#abandon">abandon</a>|ed <code class="special">{name}</code>s will
			still be added to the argument list, but won't be
			edited. No check for duplicates is done.
			Also see |<a href="editing.html#++opt">++opt</a>| and |<a href="editing.html#+cmd">+cmd</a>|.

:<code class="special">[count]</code>arga[dd] <code class="special">{name}</code> ..			<b class="vimtag">*<a name=":arga">:arga</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name=":argadd">:argadd</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="E479">E479</a>*</b>
:<code class="special">[count]</code>arga[dd]
			Add the <code class="special">{name}</code>s to the argument list.  When <code class="special">{name}</code> is
			omitted add the current buffer name to the argument
			list.
			If <code class="special">[count]</code> is omitted, the <code class="special">{name}</code>s are added just
			after the current entry in the argument list.
			Otherwise they are added after the <code class="special">[count]</code>'th file.
			If the argument list is "a b c", and "b" is the
			current argument, then these commands result in:
<code class="section">				command		new argument list </code>
				:argadd x	a b x c
				:0argadd x	x a b c
				:1argadd x	a x b c
				:$argadd x	a b c x
			And after the last one:
				:+2argadd y	a b c x y
			There is no check for duplicates, it is possible to
			add a file to the argument list twice.
			The currently edited file is not changed.
			<code class="note">Note:</code> you can also use this method:
<code class="example">				:args ## x</code>
			This will add the "x" item and sort the new list.

:argd[elete] <code class="special">{pattern}</code> ..			<b class="vimtag">*<a name=":argd">:argd</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name=":argdelete">:argdelete</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="E480">E480</a>*</b>
			Delete files from the argument list that match the
			<code class="special">{pattern}</code>s.  <code class="special">{pattern}</code> is used like a file pattern,
			see |<a href="autocmd.html#file-pattern">file-pattern</a>|.  "%" can be used to delete the
			current entry.
			This command keeps the currently edited file, also
			when it's deleted from the argument list.
			Example:
<code class="example">				:argdel *.obj</code>
<code class="example"></code>
:<code class="special">[range]</code>argd[elete]	Delete the <code class="special">{range}</code> files from the argument list.
			Example:
<code class="example">				:10,$argdel</code>
&lt;			Deletes arguments 10 and further, keeping 1-9.
<code class="example">				:$argd</code>
&lt;			Deletes just the last one.
<code class="example">				:argd</code>
<code class="example">				:.argd</code>
&lt;			Deletes the current argument.
<code class="example">				:%argd</code>
			Removes all the files from the arglist.
			When the last number in the range is too high, up to
			the last argument is deleted.

			Same as :wnext, but go to previous file instead of
			next.

The <code class="special">[count]</code> in the commands above defaults to one.  For some commands it is
possible to use two counts.  The last one (rightmost one) is used.

If no [+cmd] argument is present, the cursor is positioned at the last known
cursor position for the file.  If 'startofline' is set, the cursor will be
positioned at the first non-blank in the line, otherwise the last know column
is used.  If there is no last known cursor position the cursor will be in the
first line (the last line in Ex mode).

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="{arglist}">{arglist}</a>*</b>
The wildcards in the argument list are expanded and the file names are sorted.
Thus you can use the command "vim *.c" to edit all the C files.  From within
Vim the command ":n *.c" does the same.

White space is used to separate file names.  Put a backslash before a space or
tab to include it in a file name.  E.g., to edit the single file "foo bar":
<code class="example">	:next foo\ bar</code>
<code class="example"></code>
On Unix and a few other systems you can also use backticks, for example:
<code class="example">	:next `find . -name \\*.c -print`</code>
The backslashes before the star are required to prevent "*.c" to be expanded
by the shell before executing the find program.

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="arglist-position">arglist-position</a>*</b>
When there is an argument list you can see which file you are editing in the
title of the window (if there is one and 'title' is on) and with the file
message you get with the "<code class="keystroke">CTRL-G</code>" command.  You will see something like
	(file 4 of 11)
If 'shortmess' contains 'f' it will be
	(4 of 11)
If you are not really editing the file at the current position in the argument
list it will be
	(file (4) of 11)
This means that you are position 4 in the argument list, but not editing the
fourth file in the argument list.  This happens when you do ":e file".


LOCAL ARGUMENT LIST

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name=":arglocal">:arglocal</a>*</b>
:argl[ocal]		Make a local copy of the global argument list.
			Doesn't start editing another file.

:argl[ocal][!] [++opt] [+cmd] <code class="special">{arglist}</code>
			Define a new argument list, which is local to the
			current window.  Works like |<a href="editing.html#:args_f">:args_f</a>| otherwise.

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name=":argglobal">:argglobal</a>*</b>
:argg[lobal]		Use the global argument list for the current window.
			Doesn't start editing another file.

:argg[lobal][!] [++opt] [+cmd] <code class="special">{arglist}</code>
			Use the global argument list for the current window.
			Define a new global argument list like |<a href="editing.html#:args_f">:args_f</a>|.
			All windows using the global argument list will see
			this new list.

There can be several argument lists.  They can be shared between windows.
When they are shared, changing the argument list in one window will also
change it in the other window.

When a window is split the new window inherits the argument list from the
current window.  The two windows then share this list, until one of them uses
|<a href="editing.html#:arglocal">:arglocal</a>| or |<a href="editing.html#:argglobal">:argglobal</a>| to use another argument list.


USING THE ARGUMENT LIST

						<b class="vimtag">*<a name=":argdo">:argdo</a>*</b>
:<code class="special">[range]</code>argdo[!] <code class="special">{cmd}</code>	Execute <code class="special">{cmd}</code> for each file in the argument list or
			if <code class="special">[range]</code> is specified only for arguments in that
			range.  It works like doing this:
<code class="example">				:rewind</code>
<code class="example">				:<code class="special">{cmd}</code></code>
<code class="example">				:next</code>
<code class="example">				:<code class="special">{cmd}</code></code>
<code class="example">				etc.</code>
			When the current file can't be |<a href="editing.html#abandon">abandon</a>|ed and the [!]
			is not present, the command fails.
			When an error is detected on one file, further files
			in the argument list will not be visited.
			The last file in the argument list (or where an error

Example:
<code class="example">	:args *.c</code>
<code class="example">	:argdo set ff=unix | update</code>
This sets the 'fileformat' option to "unix" and writes the file if it is now
changed.  This is done for all *.c files.

Example:
<code class="example">	:args *.[ch]</code>
<code class="example">	:argdo %s/\<code class="special">&lt;my_foo\&gt;</code>/My_Foo/ge | update</code>
This changes the word "my_foo" to "My_Foo" in all <b class="vimtag">*<a name=".c and ">.c and </a>*</b>.h files.  The "e"
flag is used for the ":substitute" command to avoid an error for files where
"my_foo" isn't used.  ":update" writes the file only if changes were made.

The default <code class="special">[range]</code> for the ":w" command is the whole buffer (1,$).  If you
write the whole buffer, it is no longer considered changed.  When you
write it to a different file with ":w somefile" it depends on the "+" flag in
'cpoptions'.  When included, the write command will reset the 'modified' flag,
even though the buffer itself may still be different from its file.

If a file name is given with ":w" it becomes the alternate file.  This can be
used, for example, when the write fails and you want to try again later with
":w #".  This can be switched off by removing the 'A' flag from the
'cpoptions' option.

<code class="note">Note</code> that the 'fsync' option matters here.  If it's set it may make writes

Vim will warn you if you try to overwrite a file that has been changed
elsewhere.  See |<a href="editing.html#timestamp">timestamp</a>|.

			    <b class="vimtag">*<a name="backup">backup</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="E207">E207</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="E506">E506</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="E507">E507</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="E508">E508</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="E509">E509</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="E510">E510</a>*</b>
If you write to an existing file (but do not append) while the 'backup',
'writebackup' or 'patchmode' option is on, a backup of the original file is
made.  The file is either copied or renamed (see 'backupcopy').  After the
file has been successfully written and when the 'writebackup' option is on and
the 'backup' option is off, the backup file is deleted.  When the 'patchmode'
option is on the backup file may be renamed.

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="backup-table">backup-table</a>*</b>
<code class="section">'backup' 'writebackup'	action	</code>
   off	     off	no backup made
   off	     on		backup current file, deleted afterwards (default)
   on	     off	delete old backup, backup current file
   on	     on		delete old backup, backup current file

When the 'backupskip' pattern matches with the name of the file which is
written, no backup file is made.  The values of 'backup' and 'writebackup' are
ignored then.

When the 'backup' option is on, an old backup file (with the same name as the
new backup file) will be deleted.  If 'backup' is not set, but 'writebackup'
is set, an existing backup file will not be deleted.  The backup file that is
made while the file is being written will have a different name.

On some filesystems it's possible that in a crash you lose both the backup and
the newly written file (it might be there but contain bogus data).  In that
case try recovery, because the swap file is synced to disk and might still be
there. |<a href="recover.html#:recover">:recover</a>|

The directories given with the 'backupdir' option are used to put the backup
file in.  (default: same directory as the written file).

Whether the backup is a new file, which is a copy of the original file, or the
original file renamed depends on the 'backupcopy' option.  See there for an
explanation of when the copy is made and when the file is renamed.

If the creation of a backup file fails, the write is not done.  If you want
to write anyway add a '!' to the command.

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="write-permissions">write-permissions</a>*</b>
When writing a new file the permissions are read-write.  For unix the mask is
0666 with additionally umask applied.  When writing a file that was read Vim
will preserve the permissions, but clear the s-bit.

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="write-readonly">write-readonly</a>*</b>
When the 'cpoptions' option contains 'W', Vim will refuse to overwrite a
readonly file.  When 'W' is not present, ":w!" will overwrite a readonly file,
if the system allows it (the directory must be writable).

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="write-fail">write-fail</a>*</b>
If the writing of the new file fails, you have to be careful not to lose
your changes AND the original file.  If there is no backup file and writing
the new file failed, you have already lost the original file!  DON'T EXIT VIM
UNTIL YOU WRITE OUT THE FILE!  If a backup was made, it is put back in place
of the original file (if possible).  If you exit Vim, and lose the changes
you made, the original file will mostly still be there.  If putting back the
original file fails, there will be an error message telling you that you
lost the original file.

						<b class="vimtag">*<a name="DOS-format-write">DOS-format-write</a>*</b>
If the 'fileformat' is "dos", <code class="special">&lt;CR&gt;</code> <code class="special">&lt;NL&gt;</code> is used for <code class="special">&lt;EOL&gt;</code>.  This is default
for Win32.  On other systems the message "[dos format]" is shown to remind you
that an unusual <code class="special">&lt;EOL&gt;</code> was used.
						<b class="vimtag">*<a name="Unix-format-write">Unix-format-write</a>*</b>
If the 'fileformat' is "unix", <code class="special">&lt;NL&gt;</code> is used for <code class="special">&lt;EOL&gt;</code>.  On Win32 the message
"[unix format]" is shown.
						<b class="vimtag">*<a name="Mac-format-write">Mac-format-write</a>*</b>
If the 'fileformat' is "mac", <code class="special">&lt;CR&gt;</code> is used for <code class="special">&lt;EOL&gt;</code>.  On non-Mac systems the
message "[mac format]" is shown.

See also |<a href="editing.html#file-formats">file-formats</a>| and the 'fileformat' and 'fileformats' options.

						<b class="vimtag">*<a name="ACL">ACL</a>*</b>
ACL stands for Access Control List.  It is an advanced way to control access
rights for a file.  It is used on new MS-Windows and Unix systems, but only
when the filesystem supports it.
   Vim attempts to preserve the ACL info when writing a file.  The backup file
will get the ACL info of the original file.
   The ACL info is also used to check if a file is read-only (when opening the
file).

						<b class="vimtag">*<a name="read-only-share">read-only-share</a>*</b>
When MS-Windows shares a drive on the network it can be marked as read-only.
This means that even if the file read-only attribute is absent, and the ACL
settings on NT network shared drives allow writing to the file, you can still
not write to the file.  Vim on Win32 platforms will detect read-only network
drives and will mark the file as read-only.  You will not be able to override
it with |<a href="editing.html#:write">:write</a>|.

						<b class="vimtag">*<a name="write-device">write-device</a>*</b>
When the file name is actually a device name, Vim will not make a backup (that
would be impossible).  You need to use "!", since the device already exists.
Example for Unix:
<code class="example">	:w! /dev/lpt0</code>
and for MS-Windows:
<code class="example">	:w! lpt0</code>
For Unix a device is detected when the name doesn't refer to a normal file or
a directory.  A fifo or named pipe also looks like a device to Vim.
For MS-Windows the device is detected by its name:
	AUX
	CON
	CLOCK$
	NUL
	PRN
	COMn	n=1,2,3... etc
	LPTn	n=1,2,3... etc
The names can be in upper- or lowercase.

			executed without a dialog.
			":browse set" works like |<a href="options.html#:options">:options</a>|.
			See also |<a href="starting.html#:oldfiles">:oldfiles</a>| for ":browse oldfiles".

The syntax is best shown via some examples:
<code class="example">	:browse e $vim/foo</code>
		Open the browser in the $vim/foo directory, and edit the
		file chosen.
<code class="example">	:browse e</code>
		Open the browser in the directory specified with 'browsedir',
		and edit the file chosen.
<code class="example">	:browse w</code>
		Open the browser in the directory of the current buffer,
		with the current buffer filename as default, and save the
		buffer under the filename chosen.
<code class="example">	:browse w C:/bar</code>
		Open the browser in the C:/bar directory, with the current
		buffer filename as default, and save the buffer under the
		filename chosen.
Also see the 'browsedir' option.
For versions of Vim where browsing is not supported, the command is executed
unmodified.

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="browsefilter">browsefilter</a>*</b>
For MS Windows and GTK, you can modify the filters that are used in the browse
dialog.  By setting the g:browsefilter or b:browsefilter variables, you can
change the filters globally or locally to the buffer.  The variable is set to
a string in the format "<code class="special">{filter label}</code>\t<code class="special">{pattern}</code>;<code class="special">{pattern}</code>\n" where {filter
label} is the text that appears in the "Files of Type" comboBox, and <code class="special">{pattern}</code>
is the pattern which filters the filenames.  Several patterns can be given,
separated by ';'.

For Motif the same format is used, but only the very first pattern is actually
used (Motif only offers one pattern, but you can edit it).

For example, to have only Vim files in the dialog, you could use the following
command:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">     let g:browsefilter = "Vim Scripts\t<b class="vimtag">*<a name=".vim\nVim Startup Files\t">.vim\nVim Startup Files\t</a>*</b>vimrc\n"</code>
<code class="example"></code>
You can override the filter setting on a per-buffer basis by setting the
b:browsefilter variable.  You would most likely set b:browsefilter in a
filetype plugin, so that the browse dialog would contain entries related to
the type of file you are currently editing.  Disadvantage: This makes it
difficult to start editing a file of a different type.  To overcome this, you
may want to add "All Files\t<b class="vimtag">*<a name=".">.</a>*</b>\n" as the final filter, so that the user can
still access any desired file.

To avoid setting browsefilter when Vim does not actually support it, you can
use has("browsefilter"):
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	if has("browsefilter")</code>
<code class="example">	   let g:browsefilter = "whatever"</code>
<code class="example">	endif</code>

You can use the |<a href="editing.html#:cd">:cd</a>|, |<a href="editing.html#:tcd">:tcd</a>| and |<a href="editing.html#:lcd">:lcd</a>| commands to change to another
directory, so you will not have to type that directory name in front of the
file names.  It also makes a difference for executing external commands, e.g.
":!ls".

Changing directory fails when the current buffer is modified, the '.' flag is
present in 'cpoptions' and "!" is not used in the command.

:cd[!]			On non-Unix systems: Print the current directory
			name.  On Unix systems: Change the current directory
			to the home directory.  Use |<a href="editing.html#:pwd">:pwd</a>| to print the
			current directory on all systems.
			On Unix systems: clear any window-local directory.

:cd[!] <code class="special">{path}</code>		Change the current directory to <code class="special">{path}</code>.
			If <code class="special">{path}</code> is relative, it is searched for in the
			directories listed in |<a href="options.html#'cdpath'">'cdpath'</a>|.
			Clear any window-local directory.

<code class="example">				:cd %:h</code>

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name=":cd-">:cd-</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="E186">E186</a>*</b>

:tcd[!] <code class="special">{path}</code>		Like |<a href="editing.html#:cd">:cd</a>|, but only set the directory for the current
			tab.  The current window will also use this directory.
			The current directory is not changed for windows in
			other tabs and for windows in the current tab that
			have their own window-local directory.

So long as no |<a href="editing.html#:lcd">:lcd</a>| or |<a href="editing.html#:tcd">:tcd</a>| command has been used, all windows share the
same current directory.  Using a command to jump to another window doesn't
change anything for the current directory.

When a |<a href="editing.html#:lcd">:lcd</a>| command has been used for a window, the specified directory
becomes the current directory for that window.  Windows where the |<a href="editing.html#:lcd">:lcd</a>|
command has not been used stick to the global or tab-local current directory.
When jumping to another window the current directory will become the last
specified local current directory.  If none was specified, the global or
tab-local current directory is used.

When a |<a href="editing.html#:tcd">:tcd</a>| command has been used for a tab page, the specified directory
becomes the current directory for the current tab page and the current window.
The current directory of other tab pages is not affected.  When jumping to
another tab page, the current directory will become the last specified local
directory for that tab page. If the current tab has no local current directory
the global current directory is used.

When a |<a href="editing.html#:cd">:cd</a>| command is used, the current window and tab page will lose the
local current directory and will use the global current directory from now on.

After using |<a href="editing.html#:cd">:cd</a>| the full path name will be used for reading and writing
files.  On some networked file systems this may cause problems.  The result of
using the full path name is that the file names currently in use will remain
referring to the same file.  Example: If you have a file a:test and a
directory a:vim the commands ":e test" ":cd vim" ":w" will overwrite the file
a:test and not write a:vim/test.  But if you do ":w test" the file a:vim/test
will be written, because you gave a new file name and did not refer to a
filename before the ":cd".

</pre><hr/><pre>8. Editing binary files					<b class="vimtag">*<a name="edit-binary">edit-binary</a>*</b>

Although Vim was made to edit text files, it is possible to edit binary
files.  The |<a href="starting.html#-b">-b</a>| Vim argument (b for binary) makes Vim do file I/O in binary
mode, and sets some options for editing binary files ('binary' on, 'textwidth'
to 0, 'modeline' off, 'expandtab' off).  Setting the 'binary' option has the
same effect.  Don't forget to do this before reading the file.

There are a few things to remember when editing binary files:
- When editing executable files the number of characters must not change.
  Use only the "R" or "r" command to change text.  Do not delete characters
  with "x" or by backspacing.
- Set the 'textwidth' option to 0.  Otherwise lines will unexpectedly be
  split in two.
- When there are not many <code class="special">&lt;EOL&gt;</code>s, the lines will become very long.  If you
  want to edit a line that does not fit on the screen reset the 'wrap' option.
  Horizontal scrolling is used then.  If a line becomes too long (more than
  about 32767 characters on the Amiga, much more on 32-bit systems, see
  |<a href="vi_diff.html#limits">limits</a>|) you cannot edit that line.  The line will be split when reading
  the file.  It is also possible that you get an "out of memory" error when
  reading the file.
- Make sure the 'binary' option is set BEFORE loading the
  file.  Otherwise both <code class="special">&lt;CR&gt;</code> <code class="special">&lt;NL&gt;</code> and <code class="special">&lt;NL&gt;</code> are considered to end a line
  and when the file is written the <code class="special">&lt;NL&gt;</code> will be replaced with <code class="special">&lt;CR&gt;</code> <code class="special">&lt;NL&gt;</code>.
- <code class="special">&lt;Nul&gt;</code> characters are shown on the screen as ^@.  You can enter them with
  "<code class="keystroke">CTRL-V</code> CTRL-@" or "<code class="keystroke">CTRL-V</code> 000"
- To insert a <code class="special">&lt;NL&gt;</code> character in the file split a line.  When writing the
  buffer to a file a <code class="special">&lt;NL&gt;</code> will be written for the <code class="special">&lt;EOL&gt;</code>.
- Vim normally appends an <code class="special">&lt;EOL&gt;</code> at the end of the file if there is none.
  Setting the 'binary' option prevents this.  If you want to add the final
  <code class="special">&lt;EOL&gt;</code>, set the 'endofline' option.  You can also read the value of this
  option to see if there was an <code class="special">&lt;EOL&gt;</code> for the last line (you cannot see this
  in the text).

</pre><hr/><pre>9. Encryption						<b class="vimtag">*<a name="encryption">encryption</a>*</b>

Vim is able to write files encrypted, and read them back.  The encrypted text
cannot be read without the right key.
{only available when compiled with the |<a href="various.html#+cryptv">+cryptv</a>| feature}  <b class="vimtag">*<a name="E833">E833</a>*</b>

The text in the swap file and the undo file is also encrypted.  <b class="vimtag">*<a name="E843">E843</a>*</b>
However, this is done block-by-block and may reduce the time needed to crack a
password.  You can disable the swap file, but then a crash will cause you to
lose your work.  The undo file can be disabled without too much disadvantage.
<code class="example">	:set noundofile</code>
<code class="example">	:noswapfile edit secrets</code>
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="note">Note:</code> The text in memory is not encrypted.  A system administrator may be able
to see your text while you are editing it.  When filtering text with
":!filter" or using ":w !command" the text is also not encrypted, this may
reveal it to others.  The 'viminfo' file is not encrypted.

You could do this to edit very secret text:
<code class="example">	:set noundofile viminfo=</code>
<code class="example">	:noswapfile edit secrets.txt</code>
Keep in mind that without a swap file you risk losing your work in the event
of a crash or a power failure.

WARNING: If you make a typo when entering the key and then write the file and
exit, the text will be lost!

The normal way to work with encryption, is to use the ":X" command, which will
ask you to enter a key.  A following write command will use that key to
encrypt the file.  If you later edit the same file, Vim will ask you to enter
a key.  If you type the same key as that was used for writing, the text will
be readable again.  If you use a wrong key, it will be a mess.

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name=":X">:X</a>*</b>
:X	Prompt for an encryption key.  The typing is done without showing the
	actual text, so that someone looking at the display won't see it.
	The typed key is stored in the 'key' option, which is used to encrypt
	the file when it is written.  The file will remain unchanged until you
	write it.  See also |<a href="starting.html#-x">-x</a>|.

The value of the 'key' options is used when text is written.  When the option
is not empty, the written file will be encrypted, using the value as the
encryption key.  A magic number is prepended, so that Vim can recognize that
the file is encrypted.

To disable the encryption, reset the 'key' option to an empty value:
<code class="example">	:set key=</code>
<code class="example"></code>
You can use the 'cryptmethod' option to select the type of encryption, use one
of these:
<code class="example">	:setlocal cm=zip        " weak method, backwards compatible</code>
<code class="example">	:setlocal cm=blowfish   " method with flaws</code>
<code class="example">	:setlocal cm=blowfish2  " medium strong method</code>
<code class="example"></code>
Do this before writing the file.  When reading an encrypted file it will be
set automatically to the method used when that file was written.  You can
change 'cryptmethod' before writing that file to change the method.

To set the default method, used for new files, use this in your |<a href="starting.html#vimrc">vimrc</a>|
file:
<code class="example">	set cm=blowfish2</code>
Using "blowfish2" is highly recommended.  Only use another method if you
must use an older Vim version that does not support it.

The message given for reading and writing a file will show "[crypted]" when
using zip, "[blowfish]" when using blowfish, etc.

When writing an undo file, the same key and method will be used for the text
in the undo file. |<a href="undo.html#persistent-undo">persistent-undo</a>|.

To test for blowfish support you can use these conditions:
<code class="example">	has('crypt-blowfish')</code>
<code class="example">	has('crypt-blowfish2')</code>
This works since Vim 7.4.1099 while blowfish support was added earlier.
Thus the condition failing doesn't mean blowfish is not supported. You can
test for blowfish with:
<code class="example">	v:version &gt;= 703</code>
And for blowfish2 with:
<code class="example">	v:version &gt; 704 || (v:version == 704 &amp;&amp; has('patch401'))</code>
If you are sure Vim includes patch 7.4.237 a simpler check is:
<code class="example">	has('patch-7.4.401')</code>

						<b class="vimtag">*<a name="E817">E817</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="E818">E818</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="E819">E819</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="E820">E820</a>*</b>
When encryption does not work properly, you would be able to write your text
to a file and never be able to read it back.  Therefore a test is performed to
check if the encryption works as expected.  If you get one of these errors
don't write the file encrypted!  You need to rebuild the Vim binary to fix
this.

<b class="vimtag">*<a name="E831">E831</a>*</b> This is an internal error, "cannot happen".  If you can reproduce it,
please report to the developers.

When reading a file that has been encrypted and the 'key' option is not empty,
it will be used for decryption.  If the value is empty, you will be prompted
to enter the key.  If you don't enter a key, or you enter the wrong key, the
file is edited without being decrypted.  There is no warning about using the
wrong key (this makes brute force methods to find the key more difficult).

If want to start reading a file that uses a different key, set the 'key'
option to an empty string, so that Vim will prompt for a new one.  Don't use
the ":set" command to enter the value, other people can read the command over
your shoulder.

Since the value of the 'key' option is supposed to be a secret, its value can
never be viewed.  You should not set this option in a vimrc file.

An encrypted file can be recognized by the "file" command, if you add these
lines to "/etc/magic", "/usr/share/misc/magic" or wherever your system has the
"magic" file:
<code class="example">     0	string	VimCrypt~	Vim encrypted file</code>
<code class="example">     &gt;9	string	01	- "zip" cryptmethod</code>
<code class="example">     &gt;9	string	02	- "blowfish" cryptmethod</code>
<code class="example">     &gt;9	string	03	- "blowfish2" cryptmethod</code>
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="note">Note</code>s:
- Encryption is not possible when doing conversion with 'charconvert'.
- Text you copy or delete goes to the numbered registers.  The registers can
  be saved in the .viminfo file, where they could be read.  Change your
  'viminfo' option to be safe.
- Someone can type commands in Vim when you walk away for a moment, he should
  not be able to get the key.
- If you make a typing mistake when entering the key, you might not be able to
  get your text back!
- If you type the key with a ":set key=value" command, it can be kept in the
  history, showing the 'key' value in a viminfo file.
- There is never 100% safety.  The encryption in Vim has not been tested for
  robustness.
- The algorithm used for 'cryptmethod' "zip" is breakable.  A 4 character key
  in about one hour, a 6 character key in one day (on a Pentium 133 PC).  This
  requires that you know some text that must appear in the file.  An expert
  can break it for any key.  When the text has been decrypted, this also means
  that the key can be revealed, and other files encrypted with the same key
  can be decrypted.
- Pkzip uses the same encryption as 'cryptmethod' "zip", and US Govt has no
  objection to its export.  Pkzip's public file APP<code class="note">NOTE</code>.TXT describes this
  algorithm in detail.
- The implementation of 'cryptmethod' "blowfish" has a flaw.  It is possible
  to crack the first 64 bytes of a file and in some circumstances more of the
  file. Use of it is not recommended, but it's still the strongest method
  supported by Vim 7.3 and 7.4.  The "zip" method is even weaker.
- Vim originates from the Netherlands.  That is where the sources come from.
  Thus the encryption code is not exported from the USA.

</pre><hr/><pre>10. Timestamps					<b class="vimtag">*<a name="timestamp">timestamp</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="timestamps">timestamps</a>*</b>

Vim remembers the modification timestamp, mode and size of a file when you
begin editing it.  This is used to avoid that you have two different versions
of the same file (without you knowing this).

After a shell command is run (|<a href="various.html#:!cmd">:!cmd</a>| |<a href="starting.html#suspend">suspend</a>| |<a href="insert.html#:read!">:read!</a>| |<a href="various.html#K">K</a>|) timestamps,
file modes and file sizes are compared for all buffers in a window.   Vim will
run any associated |<a href="autocmd.html#FileChangedShell">FileChangedShell</a>| autocommands or display a warning for
any files that have changed.  In the GUI this happens when Vim regains input
focus.

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="E321">E321</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="E462">E462</a>*</b>
If you want to automatically reload a file when it has been changed outside of
Vim, set the 'autoread' option.  This doesn't work at the moment you write the
file though, only when the file wasn't changed inside of Vim.
							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="ignore-timestamp">ignore-timestamp</a>*</b>
If you do not want to be asked or automatically reload the file, you can use
this:
<code class="example">	set buftype=nofile</code>
<code class="example"></code>
Or, when starting gvim from a shell:
<code class="example">	gvim file.log -c "set buftype=nofile"</code>
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="note">Note</code> that if a FileChangedShell autocommand is defined you will not get a
warning message or prompt.  The autocommand is expected to handle this.

There is no warning for a directory (e.g., with |<a href="pi_netrw.html#netrw-browse">netrw-browse</a>|).  But you do
get warned if you started editing a new file and it was created as a directory
later.

When Vim notices the timestamp of a file has changed, and the file is being
edited in a buffer but has not changed, Vim checks if the contents of the file
is equal.  This is done by reading the file again (into a hidden buffer, which
is immediately deleted again) and comparing the text.  If the text is equal,
you will get no warning.

If you don't get warned often enough you can use the following command.

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name=":checkt">:checkt</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name=":checktime">:checktime</a>*</b>
:checkt[ime]		Check if any buffers were changed outside of Vim.
			This checks and warns you if you would end up with two
			versions of a file.
			If this is called from an autocommand, a ":global"
			command or is not typed the actual check is postponed
			until a moment the side effects (reloading the file)
			would be harmless.
			Each loaded buffer is checked for its associated file
			being changed.  If the file was changed Vim will take
			action.  If there are no changes in the buffer and
			'autoread' is set, the buffer is reloaded.  Otherwise,
			you are offered the choice of reloading the file.  If
			the file was deleted you get an error message.
			If the file previously didn't exist you get a warning
			if it exists now.
			Once a file has been checked the timestamp is reset,
			you will not be warned again.

:[N]checkt[ime] <code class="special">{filename}</code>
:[N]checkt[ime] [N]
			Check the timestamp of a specific buffer.  The buffer
			may be specified by name, number or with a pattern.


							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="E813">E813</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="E814">E814</a>*</b>
Vim will reload the buffer if you chose to.  If a window is visible that
contains this buffer, the reloading will happen in the context of this window.
Otherwise a special window is used, so that most autocommands will work.  You
can't close this window.  A few other restrictions apply.  Best is to make
sure nothing happens outside of the current buffer.  E.g., setting
window-local options may end up in the wrong window.  Splitting the window,
doing something there and closing it should be OK (if there are no side
effects from other autocommands).  Closing unrelated windows and buffers will
get you into trouble.

Before writing a file the timestamp is checked.  If it has changed, Vim will
ask if you really want to overwrite the file:

	WARNING: The file has been changed since reading it!!!
	Do you really want to write to it (y/n)?

If you hit 'y' Vim will continue writing the file.  If you hit 'n' the write is
aborted.  If you used ":wq" or "ZZ" Vim will not exit, you will get another
chance to write the file.

The message would normally mean that somebody has written to the file after
the edit session started.  This could be another person, in which case you
probably want to check if your changes to the file and the changes from the
other person should be merged.  Write the file under another name and check for
differences (the "diff" program can be used for this).

It is also possible that you modified the file yourself, from another edit
session or with another command (e.g., a filter command).  Then you will know
which version of the file you want to keep.

There is one situation where you get the message while there is nothing wrong:
On a Win32 system on the day daylight saving time starts.  There is something
in the Win32 libraries that confuses Vim about the hour time difference.  The
problem goes away the next day.

</pre><hr/><pre>11. File Searching					<b class="vimtag">*<a name="file-searching">file-searching</a>*</b>

{not available when compiled without the |<a href="various.html#+path_extra">+path_extra</a>| feature}

The file searching is currently used for the 'path', 'cdpath' and 'tags'
options, for |<a href="eval.html#finddir()">finddir()</a>| and |<a href="eval.html#findfile()">findfile()</a>|.  Other commands use |<a href="editing.html#wildcards">wildcards</a>|
which is slightly different.

There are three different types of searching:

1) Downward search:					<b class="vimtag">*<a name="starstar">starstar</a>*</b>
   Downward search uses the wildcards '<b class="vimtag">*<a name="', '">', '</a>*</b>*' and possibly others
   supported by your operating system.  '<b class="vimtag">*<a name="' and '">' and '</a>*</b>*' are handled inside Vim,
   so they work on all operating systems.  <code class="note">Note</code> that "**" only acts as a
   special wildcard when it is at the start of a name.

   The usage of '*' is quite simple: It matches 0 or more characters.  In a
   search pattern this would be ".*".  <code class="note">Note</code> that the "." is not used for file
   searching.

   '**' is more sophisticated:
      - It ONLY matches directories.
      - It matches up to 30 directories deep by default, so you can use it to
	search an entire directory tree
      - The maximum number of levels matched can be given by appending a number
	to '**'.
	Thus '/usr/**2' can match:
<code class="example">		/usr</code>
<code class="example">		/usr/include</code>
<code class="example">		/usr/include/sys</code>
<code class="example">		/usr/include/g++</code>
<code class="example">		/usr/lib</code>
<code class="example">		/usr/lib/X11</code>
<code class="example">		....</code>
	It does NOT match '/usr/include/g++/std' as this would be three
	levels.
	The allowed number range is 0 ('**0' is removed) to 100
	If the given number is smaller than 0 it defaults to 30, if it's
	bigger than 100 then 100 is used.  The system also has a limit on the
	path length, usually 256 or 1024 bytes.
      - '**' can only be at the end of the path or be followed by a path
	separator or by a number and a path separator.

   You can combine '<b class="vimtag">*<a name="' and '">' and '</a>*</b>*' in any order:
<code class="example">	/usr/*<b class="vimtag">*<a name="%2Fsys%2F">/sys/</a>*</b></code>
<code class="example">	/usr/<b class="vimtag">*<a name="tory%2Fsys%2F">tory/sys/</a>*</b>*</code>
<code class="example">	/usr/*<b class="vimtag">*<a name="2%2Fsys%2F">2/sys/</a>*</b></code>
<code class="example"></code>
2) Upward search:
   Here you can give a directory and then search the directory tree upward for
   a file.  You could give stop-directories to limit the upward search.  The
   stop-directories are appended to the path (for the 'path' option) or to
   the filename (for the 'tags' option) with a ';'.  If you want several
   stop-directories separate them with ';'.  If you want no stop-directory
   ("search upward till the root directory) just use ';'.
<code class="example">	/usr/include/sys;/usr</code>
&lt;   will search in:
<code class="example">	   /usr/include/sys</code>
<code class="example">	   /usr/include</code>
<code class="example">	   /usr</code>

   If you use a relative path the upward search is started in Vim's current
   directory or in the directory of the current file (if the relative path
   starts with './' and 'd' is not included in 'cpoptions').

   If Vim's current path is /u/user_x/work/release and you do
<code class="example">	:set path=include;/u/user_x</code>
&lt;  and then search for a file with |<a href="editing.html#gf">gf</a>| the file is searched in:
<code class="example">	/u/user_x/work/release/include</code>
<code class="example">	/u/user_x/work/include</code>
<code class="example">	/u/user_x/include</code>
<code class="example"></code>
3) Combined up/downward search:
   If Vim's current path is /u/user_x/work/release and you do
<code class="example">	set path=**;/u/user_x</code>
&lt;  and then search for a file with |<a href="editing.html#gf">gf</a>| the file is searched in:
<code class="example">	/u/user_x/work/release/**</code>
<code class="example">	/u/user_x/work/**</code>
<code class="example">	/u/user_x/**</code>

   BE CAREFUL!  This might consume a lot of time, as the search of
   '/u/user_x/*<b class="vimtag">*<a name="' includes '%2Fu%2Fuser_x%2Fwork%2F">' includes '/u/user_x/work/</a>*</b>*' and
   '/u/user_x/work/release/*<b class="vimtag">*<a name="'.  So '%2Fu%2Fuser_x%2Fwork%2Frelease%2F">'.  So '/u/user_x/work/release/</a>*</b>*' is searched
   three times and '/u/user_x/work/**' is searched twice.

   In the above example you might want to set path to:
<code class="example">	:set path=*<b class="vimtag">*<a name=",%2Fu%2Fuser_x%2F">,/u/user_x/</a>*</b>*</code>
  This searches:
