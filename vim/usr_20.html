		     Typing command-line commands quickly


Vim has a few generic features that makes it easier to enter commands.  Colon
commands can be abbreviated, edited and repeated.  Completion is available for
nearly everything.

</pre><hr/><pre><b class="vimtag">*<a name="20.1">20.1</a>*</b>	Command line editing

When you use a colon (:) command or search for a string with / or ?, Vim puts
the cursor on the bottom of the screen.  There you type the command or search
pattern.  This is called the Command line.  Also when it's used for entering a
search command.

The most obvious way to edit the command you type is by pressing the <code class="special">&lt;BS&gt;</code> key.
This erases the character before the cursor.  To erase another character,
typed earlier, first move the cursor with the cursor keys.
   For example, you have typed this:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	:s/col/pig/</code>
<code class="example"></code>
Before you hit <code class="special">&lt;Enter&gt;</code>, you notice that "col" should be "cow".  To correct
this, you type <code class="special">&lt;Left&gt;</code> five times.  The cursor is now just after "col".  Type
<code class="special">&lt;BS&gt;</code> and "w" to correct:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	:s/cow/pig/</code>
<code class="example"></code>
Now you can press <code class="special">&lt;Enter&gt;</code> directly.  You don't have to move the cursor to the
end of the line before executing the command.

The most often used keys to move around in the command line:

	<code class="special">&lt;Left&gt;</code>			one character left
	<code class="special">&lt;Right&gt;</code>			one character right
	<code class="special">&lt;S-Left&gt;</code> or <code class="special">&lt;C-Left&gt;</code>	one word left
	<code class="special">&lt;S-Right&gt;</code> or <code class="special">&lt;C-Right&gt;</code>	one word right
	<code class="keystroke">CTRL-B</code> or <code class="special">&lt;Home&gt;</code>	to begin of command line
	<code class="keystroke">CTRL-E</code> or <code class="special">&lt;End&gt;</code>		to end of command line

	<code class="note">Note:</code>
	<code class="special">&lt;S-Left&gt;</code> (cursor left key with Shift key pressed) and <code class="special">&lt;C-Left&gt;</code> (cursor
	left key with Control pressed) will not work on all keyboards.  Same
	for the other Shift and Control combinations.

You can also use the mouse to move the cursor.


DELETING

As mentioned, <code class="special">&lt;BS&gt;</code> deletes the character before the cursor.  To delete a whole
word use <code class="keystroke">CTRL-W</code>.

<code class="section">	/the fine pig </code>

		     <code class="keystroke">CTRL-W</code>

<code class="section">	/the fine </code>

<code class="keystroke">CTRL-U</code> removes all text, thus allows you to start all over again.


OVERSTRIKE

The <code class="special">&lt;Insert&gt;</code> key toggles between inserting characters and replacing the
existing ones.  Start with this text:

<code class="section">	/the fine pig </code>

Move the cursor to the start of "fine" with <code class="special">&lt;S-Left&gt;</code> twice (or <code class="special">&lt;Left&gt;</code> eight
times, if <code class="special">&lt;S-Left&gt;</code> doesn't work).  Now press <code class="special">&lt;Insert&gt;</code> to switch to overstrike
and type "great":

<code class="section">	/the greatpig </code>

Oops, we lost the space.  Now, don't use <code class="special">&lt;BS&gt;</code>, because it would delete the
"t" (this is different from Replace mode).  Instead, press <code class="special">&lt;Insert&gt;</code> to switch
from overstrike to inserting, and type the space:

<code class="section">	/the great pig </code>


CANCELLING

You thought of executing a : or / command, but changed your mind.  To get rid
of what you already typed, without executing it, press <code class="keystroke">CTRL-C</code> or <code class="special">&lt;Esc&gt;</code>.

	<code class="note">Note:</code>
	<code class="special">&lt;Esc&gt;</code> is the universal "get out" key.  Unfortunately, in the good old
	Vi pressing <code class="special">&lt;Esc&gt;</code> in a command line executed the command!  Since that
	might be considered to be a bug, Vim uses <code class="special">&lt;Esc&gt;</code> to cancel the command.
	But with the 'cpoptions' option it can be made Vi compatible.  And
	when using a mapping (which might be written for Vi) <code class="special">&lt;Esc&gt;</code> also works
	Vi compatible.  Therefore, using <code class="keystroke">CTRL-C</code> is a method that always works.

If you are at the start of the command line, pressing <code class="special">&lt;BS&gt;</code> will cancel the
command.  It's like deleting the ":" or "/" that the line starts with.

</pre><hr/><pre><b class="vimtag">*<a name="20.2">20.2</a>*</b>	Command line abbreviations

Some of the ":" commands are really long.  We already mentioned that
":substitute" can be abbreviated to ":s".  This is a generic mechanism, all
":" commands can be abbreviated.

How short can a command get?  There are 26 letters, and many more commands.
For example, ":set" also starts with ":s", but ":s" doesn't start a ":set"
command.  Instead ":set" can be abbreviated to ":se".
   When the shorter form of a command could be used for two commands, it
stands for only one of them.  There is no logic behind which one, you have to
learn them.  In the help files the shortest form that works is mentioned.  For
example:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	:s[ubstitute]</code>
<code class="example"></code>
This means that the shortest form of ":substitute" is ":s".  The following
characters are optional.  Thus ":su" and ":sub" also work.

In the user manual we will either use the full name of command, or a short
version that is still readable.  For example, ":function" can be abbreviated
to ":fu".  But since most people don't understand what that stands for, we
will use ":fun".  (Vim doesn't have a ":funny" command, otherwise ":fun" would
be confusing too.)

It is recommended that in Vim scripts you write the full command name.  That
makes it easier to read back when you make later changes.  Except for some
often used commands like ":w" (":write") and ":r" (":read").
   A particularly confusing one is ":end", which could stand for ":endif",
":endwhile" or ":endfunction".  Therefore, always use the full name.


SHORT OPTION NAMES

In the user manual the long version of the option names is used.  Many options
also have a short name.  Unlike ":" commands, there is only one short name
that works.  For example, the short name of 'autoindent' is 'ai'.  Thus these
two commands do the same thing:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	:set autoindent</code>
<code class="example">	:set ai</code>
<code class="example"></code>
You can find the full list of long and short names here: |<a href="quickref.html#option-list">option-list</a>|.

</pre><hr/><pre><b class="vimtag">*<a name="20.3">20.3</a>*</b>	Command line completion

This is one of those Vim features that, by itself, is a reason to switch from
Vi to Vim.  Once you have used this, you can't do without.

Suppose you have a directory that contains these files:

	info.txt
	intro.txt
	bodyofthepaper.txt

To edit the last one, you use the command:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	:edit bodyofthepaper.txt</code>
<code class="example"></code>
It's easy to type this wrong.  A much quicker way is:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	:edit b<code class="special">&lt;Tab&gt;</code></code>
<code class="example"></code>
Which will result in the same command.  What happened?  The <code class="special">&lt;Tab&gt;</code> key does
completion of the word before the cursor.  In this case "b".  Vim looks in the
directory and finds only one file that starts with a "b".  That must be the
one you are looking for, thus Vim completes the file name for you.

Now type:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	:edit i<code class="special">&lt;Tab&gt;</code></code>
<code class="example"></code>
Vim will beep, and give you:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	:edit info.txt</code>
<code class="example"></code>
The beep means that Vim has found more than one match.  It then uses the first
match it found (alphabetically).  If you press <code class="special">&lt;Tab&gt;</code> again, you get:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	:edit intro.txt</code>
<code class="example"></code>
Thus, if the first <code class="special">&lt;Tab&gt;</code> doesn't give you the file you were looking for, press
it again.  If there are more matches, you will see them all, one at a time.
   If you press <code class="special">&lt;Tab&gt;</code> on the last matching entry, you will go back to what you
first typed:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	:edit i</code>
<code class="example"></code>
Then it starts all over again.  Thus Vim cycles through the list of matches.
Use <code class="keystroke">CTRL-P</code> to go through the list in the other direction:

	      <code class="special">&lt;------------------- &lt;Tab&gt;</code> -------------------------+
								  |
		  <code class="special">&lt;Tab&gt;</code> --&gt;		       <code class="special">&lt;Tab&gt;</code> --&gt;
	:edit i		      :edit info.txt		   :edit intro.txt
		  &lt;-- <code class="keystroke">CTRL-P</code>		       &lt;-- <code class="keystroke">CTRL-P</code>
	   |
	   +---------------------- <code class="keystroke">CTRL-P</code> ------------------------&gt;


CONTEXT

When you type ":set i" instead of ":edit i" and press <code class="special">&lt;Tab&gt;</code> you get:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	:set icon</code>
<code class="example"></code>
Hey, why didn't you get ":set info.txt"?  That's because Vim has context
sensitive completion.  The kind of words Vim will look for depends on the
command before it.  Vim knows that you cannot use a file name just after a
":set" command, but you can use an option name.
   Again, if you repeat typing the <code class="special">&lt;Tab&gt;</code>, Vim will cycle through all matches.
There are quite a few, it's better to type more characters first:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	:set isk<code class="special">&lt;Tab&gt;</code></code>
<code class="example"></code>
Gives:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	:set iskeyword</code>
<code class="example"></code>
Now type "=" and press <code class="special">&lt;Tab&gt;</code>:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	:set iskeyword=@,48-57,_,192-255</code>
<code class="example"></code>
What happens here is that Vim inserts the old value of the option.  Now you
can edit it.
   What is completed with <code class="special">&lt;Tab&gt;</code> is what Vim expects in that place.  Just try
it out to see how it works.  In some situations you will not get what you
want.  That's either because Vim doesn't know what you want, or because
completion was not implemented for that situation.  In that case you will get
a <code class="special">&lt;Tab&gt;</code> inserted (displayed as ^I).


LIST MATCHES

When there are many matches, you would like to see an overview.  Do this by
pressing <code class="keystroke">CTRL-D</code>.  For example, pressing <code class="keystroke">CTRL-D</code> after:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	:set is</code>
<code class="example"></code>
results in:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	:set is</code>
<code class="example">	incsearch  isfname    isident    iskeyword  isprint</code>
<code class="example">	:set is</code>
<code class="example"></code>
Vim lists the matches and then comes back with the text you typed.  You can
now check the list for the item you wanted.  If it isn't there, you can use
<code class="special">&lt;BS&gt;</code> to correct the word.  If there are many matches, type a few more
characters before pressing <code class="special">&lt;Tab&gt;</code> to complete the rest.
   If you have watched carefully, you will have noticed that "incsearch"
doesn't start with "is".  In this case "is" stands for the short name of
"incsearch".  (Many options have a short and a long name.)  Vim is clever
enough to know that you might have wanted to expand the short name of the
option into the long name.


THERE IS MORE

The <code class="keystroke">CTRL-L</code> command completes the word to the longest unambiguous string.  If
you type ":edit i" and there are files "info.txt" and "info_backup.txt" you
will get ":edit info".

The 'wildmode' option can be used to change the way completion works.
The 'wildmenu' option can be used to get a menu-like list of matches.
Use the 'suffixes' option to specify files that are less important and appear
at the end of the list of files.
The 'wildignore' option specifies files that are not listed at all.

More about all of this here: |<a href="cmdline.html#cmdline-completion">cmdline-completion</a>|

</pre><hr/><pre><b class="vimtag">*<a name="20.4">20.4</a>*</b>	Command line history

In chapter 3 we briefly mentioned the history.  The basics are that you can
use the <code class="special">&lt;Up&gt;</code> key to recall an older command line.  <code class="special">&lt;Down&gt;</code> then takes you back
to newer commands.

There are actually four histories.  The ones we will mention here are for ":"
commands and for "/" and "?" search commands.  The "/" and "?" commands share
the same history, because they are both search commands.  The two other
histories are for expressions and input lines for the input() function.
|<a href="cmdline.html#cmdline-history">cmdline-history</a>|

Suppose you have done a ":set" command, typed ten more colon commands and then
want to repeat that ":set" command again.  You could press ":" and then ten
times <code class="special">&lt;Up&gt;</code>.  There is a quicker way:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	:se<code class="special">&lt;Up&gt;</code></code>
<code class="example"></code>
Vim will now go back to the previous command that started with "se".  You have
a good chance that this is the ":set" command you were looking for.  At least
you should not have to press <code class="special">&lt;Up&gt;</code> very often (unless ":set" commands is all
you have done).

The <code class="special">&lt;Up&gt;</code> key will use the text typed so far and compare it with the lines in
the history.  Only matching lines will be used.
   If you do not find the line you were looking for, use <code class="special">&lt;Down&gt;</code> to go back to
what you typed and correct that.  Or use <code class="keystroke">CTRL-U</code> to start all over again.

To see all the lines in the history:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	:history</code>
<code class="example"></code>
That's the history of ":" commands.  The search history is displayed with this
command:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	:history /</code>
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="keystroke">CTRL-P</code> will work like <code class="special">&lt;Up&gt;</code>, except that it doesn't matter what you already
typed.  Similarly for <code class="keystroke">CTRL-N</code> and <code class="special">&lt;Down&gt;</code>.  <code class="keystroke">CTRL-P</code> stands for previous, <code class="keystroke">CTRL-N</code>
for next.

</pre><hr/><pre><b class="vimtag">*<a name="20.5">20.5</a>*</b>	Command line window

Typing the text in the command line works different from typing text in Insert
mode.  It doesn't allow many commands to change the text.  For most commands
that's OK, but sometimes you have to type a complicated command.  That's where
the command line window is useful.

Open the command line window with this command:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	q:</code>
<code class="example"></code>
Vim now opens a (small) window at the bottom.  It contains the command line
history, and an empty line at the end:

	+-------------------------------------+
	|<code class="badlink">other window			      </code>|
	|<code class="badlink">~				      </code>|
	|<code class="badlink">file=============================</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">:e c				      </code>|
	|<code class="badlink">:e config.h.in			      </code>|
	|<code class="badlink">:set path=.,/usr/include,,	      </code>|
	|<code class="badlink">:set iskeyword=@,48-57,_,192-255     </code>|
	|<code class="badlink">:set is			      </code>|
	|<code class="badlink">:q				      </code>|
	|<code class="badlink">:				      </code>|
	|<code class="badlink">command-line=========================</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">				      </code>|
	+-------------------------------------+

You are now in Normal mode.  You can use the "hjkl" keys to move around.  For
example, move up with "5k" to the ":e config.h.in" line.  Type "$h" to go to
the "i" of "in" and type "cwout".  Now you have changed the line to:

<code class="section">	:e config.h.out </code>

Now press <code class="special">&lt;Enter&gt;</code> and this command will be executed.  The command line window
will close.
   The <code class="special">&lt;Enter&gt;</code> command will execute the line under the cursor.  It doesn't
matter whether Vim is in Insert mode or in Normal mode.
   Changes in the command line window are lost.  They do not result in the
history to be changed.  Except that the command you execute will be added to
the end of the history, like with all executed commands.

The command line window is very useful when you want to have overview of the
history, lookup a similar command, change it a bit and execute it.  A search
command can be used to find something.
   In the previous example the "?config" search command could have been used
to find the previous command that contains "config".  It's a bit strange,
because you are using a command line to search in the command line window.
While typing that search command you can't open another command line window,
there can be only one.
