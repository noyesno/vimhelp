</pre><hr/><pre>2. Vimball Introduction						<b class="vimtag">*<a name="vimball-intro">vimball-intro</a>*</b>

	Vimball is intended to make life simpler for users of plugins.  All
	a user needs to do with a vimball is:
<code class="example">		vim someplugin.vba</code>
<code class="example">		:so %</code>
<code class="example">		:q</code>
	and the plugin and all its components will be installed into their
	appropriate directories.  <code class="note">Note</code> that one doesn't need to be in any
	particular directory when one does this.  Plus, any help for the
	plugin will also be automatically installed.

	If a user has decided to use the AsNeeded plugin, vimball is smart
	enough to put scripts nominally intended for .vim/plugin/ into
	.vim/AsNeeded/ instead.

	Removing a plugin that was installed with vimball is really easy:
<code class="example">		vim</code>
<code class="example">		:RmVimball someplugin</code>
	This operation is not at all easy for zips and tarballs, for example.

	Vimball examines the user's |<a href="options.html#'runtimepath'">'runtimepath'</a>| to determine where to put
	the scripts.  The first directory mentioned on the runtimepath is
	usually used if possible.  Use
<code class="example">		:echo &amp;rtp</code>
	to see that directory.


</pre><hr/><pre>3. Vimball Manual					<b class="vimtag">*<a name="vimball-manual">vimball-manual</a>*</b>

MAKING A VIMBALL						<b class="vimtag">*<a name=":MkVimball">:MkVimball</a>*</b>
		:<code class="special">[range]</code>MkVimball[!] filename [path]

	The range is composed of lines holding paths to files to be included
	in your new vimball, omitting the portion of the paths that is
	normally specified by the runtimepath (|<a href="options.html#'rtp'">'rtp'</a>|).  As an example:
<code class="example">		plugin/something.vim</code>
<code class="example">		doc/something.txt</code>
&lt;	using
<code class="example">		:<code class="special">[range]</code>MkVimball filename</code>

	on this range of lines will create a file called "filename.vba" which
	can be used by Vimball.vim to re-create these files.  If the
	"filename.vba" file already exists, then MkVimball will issue a
	warning and not create the file.  <code class="note">Note</code> that these paths are relative
	to your .vim (vimfiles) directory, and the files should be in that
	directory.  The vimball plugin normally uses the first |<a href="options.html#'runtimepath'">'runtimepath'</a>|
	directory that exists as a prefix; don't use absolute paths, unless
	the user has specified such a path.

	If you use the exclamation point (!), then MkVimball will create the
	"filename.vba" file, overwriting it if it already exists.  This
	behavior resembles that for |<a href="editing.html#:w">:w</a>|.

	If you wish to force slashes into the filename, that can also be done
	by using the exclamation mark (ie. :MkVimball! path/filename).

	The tip at http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Using_VimBall_with_%27Make%27
	has a good idea on how to automate the production of vimballs using
	make.


MAKING DIRECTORIES VIA VIMBALLS				<b class="vimtag">*<a name="g:vimball_mkdir">g:vimball_mkdir</a>*</b>

	First, the |<a href="eval.html#mkdir()">mkdir()</a>| command is tried (not all systems support it).

	If it doesn't exist, then if g:vimball_mkdir doesn't exist, it is set
	as follows:
<code class="example">	  |<a href="pi_netrw.html#g:netrw_localmkdir">g:netrw_localmkdir</a>|, if it exists</code>
<code class="example">	  "mkdir"             , if it is executable</code>
<code class="example">	  "makedir"           , if it is executable</code>
<code class="example">	  Otherwise           , it is undefined.</code>
	One may explicitly specify the directory making command using
	g:vimball_mkdir.  This command is used to make directories that
	are needed as indicated by the vimball.


CONTROLLING THE VIMBALL EXTRACTION DIRECTORY		<b class="vimtag">*<a name="g:vimball_home">g:vimball_home</a>*</b>

	You may override the use of the |<a href="options.html#'runtimepath'">'runtimepath'</a>| by specifying a
	variable, g:vimball_home.

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="vimball-extract">vimball-extract</a>*</b>
		vim filename.vba

	Simply editing a Vimball will cause Vimball.vim to tell the user to
	source the file to extract its contents.

	Extraction will only proceed if the first line of a putative vimball
	file holds the "Vimball Archiver by Charles E. Campbell" line.

LISTING FILES IN A VIMBALL					<b class="vimtag">*<a name=":VimballList">:VimballList</a>*</b>

		:VimballList

	This command will tell Vimball to list the files in the archive, along
	with their lengths in lines.

MANUALLY INVOKING VIMBALL EXTRACTION				<b class="vimtag">*<a name=":UseVimball">:UseVimball</a>*</b>

		:UseVimball [path]

	This command is contained within the vimball itself; it invokes the
	vimball#Vimball() routine which is responsible for unpacking the
	vimball.  One may choose to execute it by hand instead of sourcing
	the vimball; one may also choose to specify a path for the
	installation, thereby overriding the automatic choice of the first
	existing directory on the |<a href="options.html#'runtimepath'">'runtimepath'</a>|.

REMOVING A VIMBALL						<b class="vimtag">*<a name=":RmVimball">:RmVimball</a>*</b>

		:RmVimball vimballfile [path]

	This command removes all files generated by the specified vimball
	(but not any directories it may have made).  One may choose a path
	for de-installation, too (see |<a href="options.html#'runtimepath'">'runtimepath'</a>|); otherwise, the
	default is the first existing directory on the |<a href="options.html#'runtimepath'">'runtimepath'</a>|.
	To implement this, a file (.VimballRecord) is made in that directory
	containing a record of what files need to be removed for all vimballs
	used thus far.

PREVENTING LOADING

	If for some reason you don't want to be able to extract plugins
	using vimballs: you may prevent the loading of vimball.vim by
	putting the following two variables in your <code class="special">&lt;.vimrc&gt;</code>:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">		let g:loaded_vimballPlugin= 1</code>
<code class="example">		let g:loaded_vimball      = 1</code>

WINDOWS							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="vimball-windows">vimball-windows</a>*</b>

	Many vimball files are compressed with gzip.  Windows, unfortunately,
	does not come provided with a tool to decompress gzip'ped files.
	Fortunately, there are a number of tools available for Windows users
	to un-gzip files:

<code class="example">	    Item     Tool/Suite   Free   Website</code>
<code class="example">	    ----     ----------   ----   -------</code>
<code class="example">	    7zip        tool       y     http://www.7-zip.org/</code>
<code class="example">	    Winzip      tool       n     http://www.winzip.com/downwz.htm</code>
<code class="example">	    unxutils    suite      y     http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/</code>
<code class="example">	    cygwin      suite      y     http://www.cygwin.com/</code>
<code class="example">	    GnuWin32    suite      y     http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/</code>
<code class="example">	    MinGW       suite      y     http://www.mingw.org/</code>

			    the autocmds in vimballPlugin.vim
	     Jul 06, 2015 * there are two uses of tabc; changed to tabc!
	34 : Sep 22, 2011 * "UseVimball path" now supports a non-full path by
			    prepending the current directory to it.
	33 : Apr 02, 2011 <b class="vimtag">*<a name=" Gave priority to "> Gave priority to </a>*</b>.vmb over *.vba

			    compression types) now works
			  * (Jan Steffens) added support for xz compression
			  * fenc extraction was erroneously picking up the
			    end of the line number when no file encoding
			    was present.  Fixed.
			  * By request, beginning the switchover from the vba
			    extension to vmb.  Currently both are supported;

			    handling of zero-length files
	     Feb 18, 2016 * Changed =~ to =~# where appropriate
	30 : Dec 08, 2008 * fnameescape() inserted to protect error
			    messaging using corrupted filenames from
			    causing problems
			  * RmVimball supports filenames that would
			    otherwise be considered to have "magic"
			    characters (ie. Abc[1].vba)

			    necessary.
	     May 30, 2008 * (tnx to Bill McCarthy) found and fixed a bug:
			    vimball wasn't updating plugins to AsNeeded/
			    when it should
	25 : Mar 24, 2008 <b class="vimtag">*<a name=" changed vimball%23Vimball() to recognize doc%2F"> changed vimball#Vimball() to recognize doc/</a>*</b>.??x
			    files as help files, too.
	     Apr 18, 2008 * RmVimball command is now protected by saving and
	                    restoring settings -- in particular, acd was

	                    removed.
	18 : Aug 01, 2006 * vimballs now use folding to easily display their
	                    contents.
			  * if a user has AsNeeded/somefile, then vimball
			    will extract plugin/somefile to the AsNeeded/
			    directory
	17 : Jun 28, 2006 * changes all \s to /s internally for Windows
	16 : Jun 15, 2006 * A. Mechelynck's idea to allow users to specify

	11 : Apr 27, 2006 * VimballList would create missing subdirectories that
			    the vimball specified were needed.  Fixed.

	3  : Mar 20, 2006 * removed query, now requires sourcing to be
			    extracted (:so %).  Message to that effect
			    included.
