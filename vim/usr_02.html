		     VIM USER MANUAL - by Bram Moolenaar

			    The first steps in Vim


This chapter provides just enough information to edit a file with Vim.  Not
well or fast, but you can edit.  Take some time to practice with these
commands, they form the base for what follows.

</pre><hr/><pre><b class="vimtag">*<a name="02.1">02.1</a>*</b>	Running Vim for the First Time

To start Vim, enter this command:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	gvim file.txt</code>
<code class="example"></code>
In UNIX you can type this at any command prompt.  If you are running Microsoft
Windows, open a Command Prompt and enter the command.
   In either case, Vim starts editing a file called file.txt.  Because this
is a new file, you get a blank window. This is what your screen will look
like:

	+---------------------------------------+
	|<code class="badlink">#					</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">~					</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">~					</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">~					</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">~					</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">"file" [New file]			</code>|
	+---------------------------------------+
		('#" is the cursor position.)

The tilde (~) lines indicate lines not in the file.  In other words, when Vim
runs out of file to display, it displays tilde lines.  At the bottom of the
screen, a message line indicates the file is named file.txt and shows that you
are creating a new file.  The message information is temporary and other
information overwrites it.


THE VIM COMMAND

The gvim command causes the editor to create a new window for editing.  If you
use this command:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	vim file.txt</code>
<code class="example"></code>
the editing occurs inside your command window.  In other words, if you are
running inside an xterm, the editor uses your xterm window.  If you are using
an MS-Windows command prompt window, the editing occurs inside this window.
The text in the window will look the same for both versions, but with gvim you
have extra features, like a menu bar.  More about that later.

</pre><hr/><pre><b class="vimtag">*<a name="02.2">02.2</a>*</b>	Inserting text

The Vim editor is a modal editor.  That means that the editor behaves
differently, depending on which mode you are in.  The two basic modes are
called Normal mode and Insert mode.  In Normal mode the characters you type
are commands.  In Insert mode the characters are inserted as text.
   Since you have just started Vim it will be in Normal mode.  To start Insert
mode you type the "i" command (i for Insert).  Then you can enter
the text.  It will be inserted into the file.  Do not worry if you make
mistakes; you can correct them later.  To enter the following programmer's
limerick, this is what you type:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	iA very intelligent turtle</code>
<code class="example">	Found programming UNIX a hurdle</code>
<code class="example"></code>
After typing "turtle" you press the <code class="special">&lt;Enter&gt;</code> key to start a new line.  Finally
you press the <code class="special">&lt;Esc&gt;</code> key to stop Insert mode and go back to Normal mode.  You
now have two lines of text in your Vim window:

	+---------------------------------------+
	|<code class="badlink">A very intelligent turtle		</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">Found programming UNIX a hurdle	</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">~					</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">~					</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">					</code>|
	+---------------------------------------+


WHAT IS THE MODE?

To be able to see what mode you are in, type this command:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	:set showmode</code>
<code class="example"></code>
You will notice that when typing the colon Vim moves the cursor to the last
line of the window.  That's where you type colon commands (commands that start
with a colon).  Finish this command by pressing the <code class="special">&lt;Enter&gt;</code> key (all commands
that start with a colon are finished this way).
   Now, if you type the "i" command Vim will display --INSERT-- at the bottom
of the window.  This indicates you are in Insert mode.

	+---------------------------------------+
	|<code class="badlink">A very intelligent turtle		</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">Found programming UNIX a hurdle	</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">~					</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">~					</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">-- INSERT --				</code>|
	+---------------------------------------+

If you press <code class="special">&lt;Esc&gt;</code> to go back to Normal mode the last line will be made blank.


GETTING OUT OF TROUBLE

One of the problems for Vim novices is mode confusion, which is caused by
forgetting which mode you are in or by accidentally typing a command that
switches modes.  To get back to Normal mode, no matter what mode you are in,
press the <code class="special">&lt;Esc&gt;</code> key.  Sometimes you have to press it twice.  If Vim beeps back
at you, you already are in Normal mode.

</pre><hr/><pre><b class="vimtag">*<a name="02.3">02.3</a>*</b>	Moving around

After you return to Normal mode, you can move around by using these keys:

	h   left						<b class="vimtag">*<a name="hjkl">hjkl</a>*</b>
	j   down
	k   up
	l   right

At first, it may appear that these commands were chosen at random.  After all,
who ever heard of using l for right?  But actually, there is a very good
reason for these choices: Moving the cursor is the most common thing you do in
an editor, and these keys are on the home row of your right hand.  In other
words, these commands are placed where you can type them the fastest
(especially when you type with ten fingers).

	<code class="note">Note:</code>
	You can also move the cursor by using the arrow keys.  If you do,
	however, you greatly slow down your editing because to press the arrow
	keys, you must move your hand from the text keys to the arrow keys.
	Considering that you might be doing it hundreds of times an hour, this
	can take a significant amount of time.
	   Also, there are keyboards which do not have arrow keys, or which
	locate them in unusual places; therefore, knowing the use of the hjkl
	keys helps in those situations.

One way to remember these commands is that h is on the left, l is on the
right and j points down.  In a picture:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">		       k</code>
<code class="example">		   h     l</code>
<code class="example">		     j</code>
<code class="example"></code>
The best way to learn these commands is by using them.  Use the "i" command to
insert some more lines of text.  Then use the hjkl keys to move around and
insert a word somewhere.  Don't forget to press <code class="special">&lt;Esc&gt;</code> to go back to Normal
mode.  The |<a href="usr_01.html#vimtutor">vimtutor</a>| is also a nice way to learn by doing.

For Japanese users, Hiroshi Iwatani suggested using this:

			Komsomolsk
			    ^
			    |
	   Huan Ho	<code class="special">&lt;--- ---&gt;</code>  Los Angeles
	(Yellow river)	    |
			    v
			  Java (the island, not the programming language)

</pre><hr/><pre><b class="vimtag">*<a name="02.4">02.4</a>*</b>	Deleting characters

To delete a character, move the cursor over it and type "x".  (This is a
throwback to the old days of the typewriter, when you deleted things by typing
xxxx over them.)  Move the cursor to the beginning of the first line, for
example, and type xxxxxxx (seven x's) to delete "A very ".  The result should
look like this:

	+---------------------------------------+
	|<code class="badlink">intelligent turtle			</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">Found programming UNIX a hurdle	</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">~					</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">~					</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">					</code>|
	+---------------------------------------+

Now you can insert new text, for example by typing:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	iA young <code class="special">&lt;Esc&gt;</code></code>
<code class="example"></code>
This begins an insert (the i), inserts the words "A young", and then exits
insert mode (the final <code class="special">&lt;Esc&gt;</code>).	The result:

	+---------------------------------------+
	|<code class="badlink">A young intelligent turtle		</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">Found programming UNIX a hurdle	</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">~					</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">~					</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">					</code>|
	+---------------------------------------+


DELETING A LINE

To delete a whole line use the "dd" command.  The following line will
then move up to fill the gap:

	+---------------------------------------+
	|<code class="badlink">Found programming UNIX a hurdle	</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">~					</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">~					</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">~					</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">					</code>|
	+---------------------------------------+


DELETING A LINE BREAK

In Vim you can join two lines together, which means that the line break
between them is deleted.  The "J" command does this.
   Take these two lines:

<code class="section">	A young intelligent </code>
<code class="section">	turtle </code>

Move the cursor to the first line and press "J":

<code class="section">	A young intelligent turtle </code>

</pre><hr/><pre><b class="vimtag">*<a name="02.5">02.5</a>*</b>	Undo and Redo

Suppose you delete too much.  Well, you can type it in again, but an easier
way exists.  The "u" command undoes the last edit.  Take a look at this in
action: After using "dd" to delete the first line, "u" brings it back.
   Another one: Move the cursor to the A in the first line:

<code class="section">	A young intelligent turtle </code>

Now type xxxxxxx to delete "A young".  The result is as follows:

<code class="section">	 intelligent turtle </code>

Type "u" to undo the last delete.  That delete removed the g, so the undo
restores the character.

<code class="section">	g intelligent turtle </code>

The next "u" command restores the next-to-last character deleted:

<code class="section">	ng intelligent turtle </code>

The next "u" command gives you the u, and so on:

<code class="section">	ung intelligent turtle </code>
<code class="section">	oung intelligent turtle </code>
<code class="section">	young intelligent turtle </code>
<code class="section">	 young intelligent turtle </code>
<code class="section">	A young intelligent turtle </code>

	<code class="note">Note:</code>
	If you type "u" twice, and the result is that you get the same text
	back, you have Vim configured to work Vi compatible.  Look here to fix
	this: |<a href="usr_01.html#not-compatible">not-compatible</a>|.
	   This text assumes you work "The Vim Way".  You might prefer to use
	the good old Vi way, but you will have to watch out for small
	differences in the text then.


REDO

If you undo too many times, you can press <code class="keystroke">CTRL-R</code> (redo) to reverse the
preceding command.  In other words, it undoes the undo.  To see this in
action, press <code class="keystroke">CTRL-R</code> twice.  The character A and the space after it disappear:

<code class="section">	young intelligent turtle </code>

There's a special version of the undo command, the "U" (undo line) command.
The undo line command undoes all the changes made on the last line that was
edited.  Typing this command twice cancels the preceding "U".

<code class="section">	A very intelligent turtle </code>
	  xxxx				Delete very

<code class="section">	A intelligent turtle </code>
		      xxxxxx		Delete turtle

<code class="section">	A intelligent </code>
					Restore line with "U"
<code class="section">	A very intelligent turtle </code>
					Undo "U" with "u"
<code class="section">	A intelligent </code>

The "U" command is a change by itself, which the "u" command undoes and <code class="keystroke">CTRL-R</code>
redoes.  This might be a bit confusing.  Don't worry, with "u" and <code class="keystroke">CTRL-R</code> you
can go to any of the situations you had.  More about that in section |<a href="usr_32.html#32.2">32.2</a>|.

</pre><hr/><pre><b class="vimtag">*<a name="02.6">02.6</a>*</b>	Other editing commands

Vim has a large number of commands to change the text.  See |<a href="quickref.html#Q_in">Q_in</a>| and below.
Here are a few often used ones.


APPENDING

The "i" command inserts a character before the character under the cursor.
That works fine; but what happens if you want to add stuff to the end of the
line?  For that you need to insert text after the cursor.  This is done with
the "a" (append) command.
   For example, to change the line

<code class="section">	and that's not saying much for the turtle. </code>
to
<code class="section">	and that's not saying much for the turtle!!! </code>

move the cursor over to the dot at the end of the line. Then type "x" to
delete the period.  The cursor is now positioned at the end of the line on the
e in turtle.  Now type
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	a!!!<code class="special">&lt;Esc&gt;</code></code>
<code class="example"></code>
to append three exclamation points after the e in turtle:

<code class="section">	and that's not saying much for the turtle!!! </code>


OPENING UP A NEW LINE

The "o" command creates a new, empty line below the cursor and puts Vim in
Insert mode.  Then you can type the text for the new line.
   Suppose the cursor is somewhere in the first of these two lines:

<code class="section">	A very intelligent turtle </code>
<code class="section">	Found programming UNIX a hurdle </code>

If you now use the "o" command and type new text:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	oThat liked using Vim<code class="special">&lt;Esc&gt;</code></code>
<code class="example"></code>
The result is:

<code class="section">	A very intelligent turtle </code>
<code class="section">	That liked using Vim </code>
<code class="section">	Found programming UNIX a hurdle </code>

The "O" command (uppercase) opens a line above the cursor.


USING A COUNT

Suppose you want to move up nine lines.  You can type "kkkkkkkkk" or you can
enter the command "9k".  In fact, you can precede many commands with a number.
Earlier in this chapter, for instance, you added three exclamation points to
the end of a line by typing "a!!!<code class="special">&lt;Esc&gt;</code>".  Another way to do this is to use the
command "3a!<code class="special">&lt;Esc&gt;</code>".  The count of 3 tells the command that follows to triple
its effect.  Similarly, to delete three characters, use the command "3x".  The
count always comes before the command it applies to.

</pre><hr/><pre><b class="vimtag">*<a name="02.7">02.7</a>*</b>	Getting out

To exit, use the "ZZ" command.  This command writes the file and exits.

	<code class="note">Note:</code>
	Unlike many other editors, Vim does not automatically make a backup
	file.  If you type "ZZ", your changes are committed and there's no
	turning back.  You can configure the Vim editor to produce backup
	files; see |<a href="usr_07.html#07.4">07.4</a>|.


DISCARDING CHANGES

Sometimes you will make a sequence of changes and suddenly realize you were
better off before you started.  Not to worry; Vim has a
quit-and-throw-things-away command.  It is:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	:q!</code>
<code class="example"></code>
Don't forget to press <code class="special">&lt;Enter&gt;</code> to finish the command.

For those of you interested in the details, the three parts of this command
are the colon (:), which enters Command-line mode; the q command, which tells
the editor to quit; and the override command modifier (!).
   The override command modifier is needed because Vim is reluctant to throw
away changes.  If you were to just type ":q", Vim would display an error
message and refuse to exit:

<code class="section">	E37: No write since last change (use ! to override) </code>

By specifying the override, you are in effect telling Vim, "I know that what
I'm doing looks stupid, but I really want to do this."

If you want to continue editing with Vim: The ":e!" command reloads the
original version of the file.

</pre><hr/><pre><b class="vimtag">*<a name="02.8">02.8</a>*</b>	Finding help

Everything you always wanted to know can be found in the Vim help files.
Don't be afraid to ask!

If you know what you are looking for, it is usually easier to search for it
using the help system, instead of using Google.  Because the subjects follow
a certain style guide.

Also the help has the advantage of belonging to your particular Vim version.
You won't see help for commands added later.  These would not work for you.

To get generic help use this command:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	:help</code>
<code class="example"></code>
You could also use the first function key <code class="special">&lt;F1&gt;</code>.  If your keyboard has a <code class="special">&lt;Help&gt;</code>
key it might work as well.
   If you don't supply a subject, ":help" displays the general help window.
The creators of Vim did something very clever (or very lazy) with the help
system: They made the help window a normal editing window.  You can use all
the normal Vim commands to move through the help information.  Therefore h, j,
k, and l move left, down, up and right.
   To get out of the help window, use the same command you use to get out of
the editor: "ZZ".  This will only close the help window, not exit Vim.

As you read the help text, you will notice some text enclosed in vertical bars
(for example, |<a href="helphelp.html#help">help</a>|).  This indicates a hyperlink.  If you position the
cursor anywhere between the bars and press CTRL-] (jump to tag), the help
system takes you to the indicated subject.  (For reasons not discussed here,
the Vim terminology for a hyperlink is tag.  So CTRL-] jumps to the location
of the tag given by the word under the cursor.)
   After a few jumps, you might want to go back.  <code class="keystroke">CTRL-T</code> (pop tag) takes you
back to the preceding position.  <code class="keystroke">CTRL-O</code> (jump to older position) also works
nicely here.
   At the top of the help screen, there is the notation <b class="vimtag">*<a name="help.txt">help.txt</a>*</b>.  This name
between "*" characters is used by the help system to define a tag (hyperlink
destination).
   See |<a href="usr_29.html#29.1">29.1</a>| for details about using tags.

To get help on a given subject, use the following command:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	:help <code class="special">{subject}</code></code>
<code class="example"></code>
To get help on the "x" command, for example, enter the following:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	:help x</code>
<code class="example"></code>
To find out how to delete text, use this command:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	:help deleting</code>
<code class="example"></code>
To get a complete index of all Vim commands, use the following command:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	:help index</code>
<code class="example"></code>
When you need to get help for a control character command (for example,
<code class="keystroke">CTRL-A</code>), you need to spell it with the prefix "CTRL-".
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	:help <code class="keystroke">CTRL-A</code></code>
<code class="example"></code>
The Vim editor has many different modes.  By default, the help system displays
the normal-mode commands.  For example, the following command displays help
for the normal-mode <code class="keystroke">CTRL-H</code> command:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	:help <code class="keystroke">CTRL-H</code></code>
<code class="example"></code>
To identify other modes, use a mode prefix.  If you want the help for the
insert-mode version of a command, use "i_".  For <code class="keystroke">CTRL-H</code> this gives you the
following command:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	:help i_<code class="keystroke">CTRL-H</code></code>
<code class="example"></code>
When you start the Vim editor, you can use several command-line arguments.
These all begin with a dash (-).  To find what the -t argument does, for
example, use the command:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	:help -t</code>
<code class="example"></code>
The Vim editor has a number of options that enable you to configure and
customize the editor.  If you want help for an option, you need to enclose it
in single quotation marks.  To find out what the 'number' option does, for
example, use the following command:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	:help 'number'</code>
<code class="example"></code>
The table with all mode prefixes can be found below: |<a href="usr_02.html#help-summary">help-summary</a>|.

Special keys are enclosed in angle brackets.  To find help on the up-arrow key
in Insert mode, for instance, use this command:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	:help i_<code class="special">&lt;Up&gt;</code></code>
<code class="example"></code>
If you see an error message that you don't understand, for example:

<code class="section">	E37: No write since last change (use ! to override) </code>

You can use the error ID at the start to find help about it:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	:help E37</code>
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example"></code>
Summary: 					<b class="vimtag">*<a name="help-summary">help-summary</a>*</b>
<code class="example"></code>
1) Use Ctrl-D after typing a topic and let Vim show all available topics.
   Or press Tab to complete:
<code class="example">	:help some<code class="special">&lt;Tab&gt;</code></code>
&lt;   More information on how to use the help:
<code class="example">	:help helphelp</code>
<code class="example"></code>
2) Follow the links in bars to related help.  You can go from the detailed
   help to the user documentation, which describes certain commands more from
   a user perspective and less detailed.  E.g. after:
<code class="example">	:help pattern.txt</code>
   You can see the user guide topics |<a href="usr_03.html#03.9">03.9</a>| and |<a href="usr_27.html#usr_27.txt">usr_27</a>| in the
   introduction.

3) Options are enclosed in single apostrophes.  To go to the help topic for the
   list option:
<code class="example">	:help 'list'</code>
&lt;   If you only know you are looking for a certain option, you can also do:
<code class="example">	:help options.txt</code>
   to open the help page which describes all option handling and then search
   using regular expressions, e.g. textwidth.
   Certain options have their own namespace, e.g.:
<code class="example">	:help cpo-<code class="special">&lt;letter&gt;</code></code>
   for the corresponding flag of the 'cpoptions' settings, substitute <code class="special">&lt;letter&gt;</code>
   by a specific flag, e.g.:
<code class="example">	:help cpo-;</code>
&lt;   And for the guioption flags:
<code class="example">	:help go-<code class="special">&lt;letter&gt;</code></code>
<code class="example"></code>
4) Normal mode commands do not have a prefix. To go to the help page for the
   "gt" command:
<code class="example">	:help gt</code>
<code class="example"></code>
5) Insert mode commands start with i_.  Help for deleting a word:
<code class="example">	:help i_<code class="keystroke">CTRL-W</code></code>
<code class="example"></code>
6) Visual mode commands start with v_.  Help for jumping to the other side of
   the Visual area:
<code class="example">	:help v_o</code>
<code class="example"></code>
7) Command line editing and arguments start with c_.  Help for using the
   command argument %:
<code class="example">	:help c_%</code>
<code class="example"></code>
8) Ex-commands always start with ":", so to go to the ":s" command help:
<code class="example">	:help :s</code>
<code class="example"></code>
9) Commands specifically for debugging start with "&gt;".  To go to the help
   for the "cont" debug command:
<code class="example">	:help &gt;cont</code>
<code class="example"></code>
10) Key combinations.  They usually start with a single letter indicating
    the mode for which they can be used.  E.g.:
<code class="example">	:help i_<code class="keystroke">CTRL-X</code></code>
    takes you to the family of <code class="keystroke">CTRL-X</code> commands for insert mode which can be
    used to auto-complete different things.  <code class="note">Note</code>, that certain keys will
    always be written the same, e.g. Control will always be CTRL.
    For normal mode commands there is no prefix and the topic is available at
    :h CTRL-<code class="special">&lt;Letter&gt;</code>. E.g.
<code class="example">	:help <code class="keystroke">CTRL-W</code></code>
&lt;    In contrast
<code class="example">	:help c_<code class="keystroke">CTRL-R</code></code>
    will describe what the <code class="keystroke">CTRL-R</code> does when entering commands in the Command
    line and
<code class="example">	:help v_<code class="keystroke">CTRL-A</code></code>
&lt;    talks about incrementing numbers in visual mode and
<code class="example">	:help g_<code class="keystroke">CTRL-A</code></code>
    talks about the "g<code class="special">&lt;C-A&gt;</code>" command (e.g. you have to press "g" then
    <code class="special">&lt;<code class="keystroke">CTRL-A</code>&gt;</code>).  Here the "g" stands for the normal command "g" which always
    expects a second key before doing something similar to the commands
    starting with "z".

11) Regexp items always start with /.  So to get help for the "\+" quantifier
    in Vim regexes:
<code class="example">	:help /\+</code>
    If you need to know everything about regular expressions, start reading
    at:
<code class="example">	:help pattern.txt</code>
<code class="example"></code>
12) Registers always start with "quote". To find out about the special ":"
    register:
<code class="example">	:help quote:</code>
<code class="example"></code>
13) Vim script is available at
<code class="example">	:help eval.txt</code>
    Certain aspects of the language are available at :h expr-X where "X" is a
    single letter. E.g.
<code class="example">	:help expr-!</code>
    will take you to the topic describing the "!" (Not) operator for Vim
    script.
    Also important is
<code class="example">	:help function-list</code>
    to find a short description of all functions available.  Help topics for
    Vim script functions always include the "()", so:
<code class="example">	:help append()</code>
    talks about the append Vim script function rather than how to append text
    in the current buffer.

14) Mappings are talked about in the help page :h |<a href="map.html#map.txt">map</a>|. Use
<code class="example">	:help mapmode-i</code>
    to find out about the |<a href="map.html#:imap">:imap</a>| command.  Also use :map-topic
    to find out about certain subtopics particular for mappings.  e.g:
<code class="example">	:help :map-local</code>
&lt;    for buffer-local mappings or
<code class="example">	:help map-bar</code>
    for how the '|' is handled in mappings.

15) Command definitions are talked about :h command-topic, so use
<code class="example">	:help command-bar</code>
    to find out about the '!' argument for custom commands.

16) Window management commands always start with <code class="keystroke">CTRL-W</code>, so you find the
    corresponding help at :h <code class="keystroke">CTRL-W_letter</code>.  E.g.
<code class="example">	:help <code class="keystroke">CTRL-W_p</code></code>
&lt;    for moving the previous accessed window.  You can also access
<code class="example">	:help windows.txt</code>
    and read your way through if you are looking for window handling
    commands.

17) Use |<a href="helphelp.html#:helpgrep">:helpgrep</a>| to search in all help pages (and also of any installed
    plugins).  See |<a href="helphelp.html#:helpgrep">:helpgrep</a>| for how to use it.
    To search for a topic:
<code class="example">	:helpgrep topic</code>
&lt;    This takes you to the first match.  To go to the next one:
<code class="example">	:cnext</code>
    All matches are available in the quickfix window which can be opened
    with:
<code class="example">	:copen</code>
    Move around to the match you like and press Enter to jump to that help.

18) The user manual.  This describes help topics for beginners in a rather
    friendly way.  Start at |<a href="usr_toc.html#usr_toc.txt">usr_toc</a>| to find the table of content (as you
    might have guessed):
<code class="example">	:help usr_toc.txt</code>
    Skim over the contents to find interesting topics. The "Digraphs" and
    "Entering special characters" items are in chapter 24, so to go to that
    particular help page:
<code class="example">	:help usr_24.txt</code>
    Also if you want to access a certain chapter in the help, the chapter
    number can be accessed directly like this:
<code class="example">	:help 10.1</code>
    which goes to chapter 10.1 in |<a href="usr_10.html#usr_10.txt">usr_10</a>| and talks about recording
    macros.

19) Highlighting groups.  Always start with hl-groupname.  E.g.
<code class="example">	:help hl-WarningMsg</code>
    talks about the WarningMsg highlighting group.

20) Syntax highlighting is namespaced to :syn-topic.  E.g.
<code class="example">	:help :syn-conceal</code>
    talks about the conceal argument for the ":syn" command.

21) Quickfix commands usually start with :c while location list commands
    usually start with :l

22) Autocommand events can be found by their name:
<code class="example">	:help BufWinLeave</code>
&lt;    To see all possible events:
<code class="example">	:help autocommand-events</code>
<code class="example"></code>
23) Command-line switches always start with "-".  So for the help of the -f
    command switch of Vim use:
<code class="example">	:help -f</code>
<code class="example"></code>
24) Optional features always start with "+".  To find out about the
    conceal feature use:
<code class="example">	:help +conceal</code>
<code class="example"></code>
25) Documentation for included filetype specific functionality is usually
    available in the form ft-<code class="special">&lt;filetype&gt;</code>-<code class="special">&lt;functionality&gt;</code>.  So
<code class="example">	:help ft-c-syntax</code>
    talks about the C syntax file and the option it provides.  Sometimes,
    additional sections for omni completion
<code class="example">	:help ft-php-omni</code>
&lt;    or filetype plugins
<code class="example">	:help ft-tex-plugin</code>
    are available.

26) Error and Warning codes can be looked up directly in the help.  So
<code class="example">	:help E297</code>
&lt;    takes you exactly to the description of the swap error message and
<code class="example">	:help W10</code>
    talks about the warning "Changing a readonly file".
    Sometimes, however, those error codes are not described, but rather are
    listed at the Vim command that usually causes this.  So:
<code class="example">	:help E128</code>
    takes you to the |<a href="eval.html#:function">:function</a>| command
