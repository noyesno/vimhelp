</pre><hr/><pre>1. Introduction							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="russian-intro">russian-intro</a>*</b>

Russian language is supported perfectly well in Vim.  You can type and view
Russian text just as any other, without the need to tweak the settings.

</pre><hr/><pre>2. Russian keymaps					       <b class="vimtag">*<a name="russian-keymap">russian-keymap</a>*</b>

To switch between languages you can use your system native keyboard switcher,
or use one of the Russian keymaps, included in the Vim distribution.  For
example,

<code class="example">    :set keymap=russian-jcukenwin</code>

In the latter case, you can switch between languages even if you do not have
system Russian keyboard or independently from a system-wide keyboard settings.
See 'keymap'.  You can also map a key to switch between keyboards, if you
choose the latter option.  See |<a href="map.html#:map">:map</a>|.

For your convenience, to avoid switching between keyboards, when you need to
enter Normal mode command, you can also set 'langmap' option:

<code class="example">    :set langmap=ФИСВУАПРШОЛДЬТЩЗЙКЫЕГМЦЧНЯ;ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ,</code>
<code class="example">    фисвуапршолдьтщзйкыегмцчня;abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz</code>
<code class="example"></code>
This is in utf-8, you cannot read this if your 'encoding' is not utf-8.
You have to type this command in one line, it is wrapped for the sake of
readability.

</pre><hr/><pre>3. Localization							 <b class="vimtag">*<a name="russian-l18n">russian-l18n</a>*</b>

If you wish to use messages, help files, menus and other items translated to
Russian, you will need to install the RuVim Language Pack, available in
different codepages from

    http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/ruvim/

Make sure that your Vim is at least 6.2.506 and use ruvim 0.5 or later for
automatic installs.  Vim also needs to be compiled with |<a href="various.html#+gettext">+gettext</a>| feature for
user interface items translations to work.

After downloading an archive from RuVim project, unpack it into your
$VIMRUNTIME directory.  We recommend using UTF-8 archive.

In order to use the Russian documentation, make sure you have set the
'helplang' option to "ru".

</pre><hr/><pre>4. Known issues						       <b class="vimtag">*<a name="russian-issues">russian-issues</a>*</b>

-- If you are using Russian message translations in Win32 console, then
   you may see the output produced by "vim --help", "vim --version" commands
   and Win32 console window title appearing in a wrong codepage.  This problem
   is related to a bug in GNU gettext library and may be fixed in the future
   releases of gettext.
