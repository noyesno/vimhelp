</pre><hr/><pre>1. Introduction						<b class="vimtag">*<a name="intro">intro</a>*</b>

Vim stands for Vi IMproved.  It used to be Vi IMitation, but there are so many
improvements that a name change was appropriate.  Vim is a text editor which
includes almost all the commands from the Unix program "Vi" and a lot of new
ones.  It is very useful for editing programs and other plain text.
   All commands are given with the keyboard.  This has the advantage that you
can keep your fingers on the keyboard and your eyes on the screen.  For those
who want it, there is mouse support and a GUI version with scrollbars and
menus (see |<a href="gui.html#gui.txt">gui</a>|).

An overview of this manual can be found in the file "help.txt", |<a href="help.html#help.txt">help</a>|.
It can be accessed from within Vim with the <code class="special">&lt;Help&gt;</code> or <code class="special">&lt;F1&gt;</code> key and with the
|<a href="helphelp.html#:help">:help</a>| command (just type ":help", without the bars or quotes).
   The 'helpfile' option can be set to the name of the help file, in case it
is not located in the default place.  You can jump to subjects like with tags:
Use CTRL-] to jump to a subject under the cursor, use <code class="keystroke">CTRL-T</code> to jump back.

The differences between Vi and Vim are mentioned in |<a href="vi_diff.html#vi_diff.txt">vi_diff</a>|.

This manual refers to Vim on various machines.  There may be small differences
between different computers and terminals.  Besides the remarks given in this
document, there is a separate document for each supported system, see
|<a href="help.html#sys-file-list">sys-file-list</a>|.

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="pronounce">pronounce</a>*</b>
Vim is pronounced as one word, like Jim, not vi-ai-em.  It's written with a
capital, since it's a name, again like Jim.

This manual is a reference for all the Vim commands and options.  This is not
an introduction to the use of Vi or Vim, it gets a bit complicated here and
there.  For beginners, there is a hands-on |<a href="usr_01.html#tutor">tutor</a>|.  To learn using Vim, read
the user manual |<a href="usr_toc.html#usr_toc.txt">usr_toc</a>|.

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="book">book</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="books">books</a>*</b>
Most books on Vi and Vim contain a section for beginners.  Others are spending
more words on specific functionality.  You can find an overview of Vim books
here:

Bug reports:				<b class="vimtag">*<a name="bugs">bugs</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="bug-reports">bug-reports</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="bugreport.vim">bugreport.vim</a>*</b>

There are two ways to report bugs, both work:
1. Send bug reports to: Vim Developers <code class="special">&lt;vim-dev@vim.org&gt;</code>
   This is a maillist, you need to become a member first and many people will
   see the message.  If you don't want that, e.g. because it is a security
   issue, send it to <code class="special">&lt;bugs@vim.org&gt;</code>, this only goes to the Vim maintainer
   (that's Bram).
2. Open an issue on GitHub: https://github.com/vim/vim/issues
   The text will be forwarded to the vim-dev maillist.

Please be brief; all the time that is spent on answering mail is subtracted
from the time that is spent on improving Vim!  Always give a reproducible
example and try to find out which settings or other things trigger the bug.

Preferably start Vim with:
<code class="example">	vim --clean -u reproduce.vim</code>
Where reproduce.vim is a script that reproduces the problem.  Try different
machines, if relevant (is this an MS-Windows specific bug perhaps?).

Send me patches if you can!  If you create a pull request on
https://github.com/vim/vim then the automated checks will run and report any
obvious problems.  But you can also send the patch by email (use an attachment
to avoid white space changes).

It will help to include information about the version of Vim you are using and
your setup.  You can get the information with this command:
<code class="example">   :so $VIMRUNTIME/bugreport.vim</code>
This will create a file "bugreport.txt" in the current directory, with a lot
of information of your environment.  Before sending this out, check if it
doesn't contain any confidential information!

If Vim crashes, please try to find out where.  You can find help on this here:
|<a href="debug.html#debug.txt">debug</a>|.

In case of doubt or when you wonder if the problem has already been fixed but
you can't find a fix for it, become a member of the vim-dev maillist and ask
your question there. |<a href="intro.html#maillist">maillist</a>|

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="year-2000">year-2000</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="Y2K">Y2K</a>*</b>
Since Vim internally doesn't use dates for editing, there is no year 2000
problem to worry about.  Vim does use the time in the form of seconds since
January 1st 1970.  It is used for a time-stamp check of the edited file and
the swap file, which is not critical and should only cause warning messages.

There might be a year 2038 problem, when the seconds don't fit in a 32 bit int
anymore.  This depends on the compiler, libraries and operating system.
Specifically, time_t and the ctime() function are used.  And the time_t is
stored in four bytes in the swap file.  But that's only used for printing a
file date/time for recovery, it will never affect normal editing.

The Vim strftime() function directly uses the strftime() system function.
localtime() uses the time() system function.  getftime() uses the time
returned by the stat() system function.  If your system libraries are year
2000 compliant, Vim is too.

The user may create scripts for Vim that use external commands.  These might
introduce Y2K problems, but those are not really part of Vim itself.

In this documentation there are several references to other versions of Vi:
							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="Vi">Vi</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="vi">vi</a>*</b>
Vi	"the original".  Without further remarks this is the version
	of Vi that appeared in Sun OS 4.x.  ":version" returns
	"Version 3.7, 6/7/85".  Sometimes other versions are referred
	to.  Only runs under Unix.  Source code is now available under a
	BSD-style license.  More information on Vi can be found through:
		http://ex-vi.sourceforge.net/
							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="Posix">Posix</a>*</b>
Posix	From the IEEE standard 1003.2, Part 2: Shell and utilities.
	Generally known as "Posix".  This is a textual description of
	how Vi is supposed to work.
	See |<a href="vi_diff.html#posix-compliance">posix-compliance</a>|.
							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="Nvi">Nvi</a>*</b>
Nvi	The "New" Vi.  The version of Vi that comes with BSD 4.4 and FreeBSD.
	Very good compatibility with the original Vi, with a few extensions.
	The version used is 1.79.  ":version" returns "Version 1.79
	(10/23/96)".  There has been no release the last few years, although
	there is a development version 1.81.
	Source code is freely available.
							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="Elvis">Elvis</a>*</b>
Elvis	Another Vi clone, made by Steve Kirkendall.  Very compact but isn't
	as flexible as Vim.  Development has stalled, Elvis has left the
	building!  Source code is freely available.
							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="Neovim">Neovim</a>*</b>
Neovim	A Vim clone.  Forked the Vim source in 2014 and went a different way.
	Very much bound to github and has many more dependencies, making
	development more complex and limiting portability.  Code has been
	refactored, resulting in patches not being exchangeable with Vim.
	Supports a remote GUI and integration with scripting languages.

</pre><hr/><pre>4. Notation						<b class="vimtag">*<a name="notation">notation</a>*</b>

When syntax highlighting is used to read this, text that is not typed
literally is often highlighted with the Special group.  These are items in [],
<code class="special">{}</code> and <code class="special">&lt;&gt;</code>, and <code class="keystroke">CTRL-X</code>.

<code class="note">Note</code> that Vim uses all possible characters in commands.  Sometimes the [], <code class="special">{}</code>
and <code class="special">&lt;&gt;</code> are part of what you type, the context should make this clear.


[]		Characters in square brackets are optional.

						    <b class="vimtag">*<a name="count">count</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="[count]">[count]</a>*</b>
<code class="special">[count]</code>		An optional number that may precede the command to multiply
		or iterate the command.  If no number is given, a count of one
		is used, unless otherwise <code class="note">note</code>d.  <code class="note">Note</code> that in this manual the
		<code class="special">[count]</code> is not mentioned in the description of the command,
		but only in the explanation.  This was done to make the
		commands easier to look up.  If the 'showcmd' option is on,
		the (partially) entered count is shown at the bottom of the
		window.  You can use <code class="special">&lt;Del&gt;</code> to erase the last digit (|<a href="various.html#N%3CDel%3E">N&lt;Del&gt;</a>|).

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="[quotex]">[quotex]</a>*</b>
["x]		An optional register designation where text can be stored.
		See |<a href="change.html#registers">registers</a>|.  The x is a single character between 'a' and
		'z' or 'A' and 'Z' or '"', and in some cases (with the put
		command) between '0' and '9', '%', '#', or others.  The
		uppercase and lowercase letter designate the same register,
		but the lowercase letter is used to overwrite the previous
		register contents, while the uppercase letter is used to
		append to the previous register contents.  Without the ""x" or
		with """" the stored text is put into the unnamed register.

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="{}">{}</a>*</b>
<code class="special">{}</code>		Curly braces de<code class="note">note</code> parts of the command which must appear,
		but which can take a number of different values.  The
		differences between Vim and Vi are also given in curly braces
		(this will be clear from the context).

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="{char1-char2}">{char1-char2}</a>*</b>
<code class="special">{char1-char2}</code>	A single character from the range char1 to char2.  For
		example: <code class="special">{a-z}</code> is a lowercase letter.  Multiple ranges may be
		concatenated.  For example, <code class="special">{a-zA-Z0-9}</code> is any alphanumeric
		character.

						<b class="vimtag">*<a name="{motion}">{motion}</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="movement">movement</a>*</b>
<code class="special">{motion}</code>	A command that moves the cursor.  These are explained in
		|<a href="motion.html#motion.txt">motion</a>|.  Examples:
			w		to start of next word
			b		to begin of current word
			4j		four lines down
			/The<code class="special">&lt;CR&gt;</code>	to next occurrence of "The"
		This is used after an |<a href="motion.html#operator">operator</a>| command to move over the text
		that is to be operated upon.
		- If the motion includes a count and the operator also has a
		  count, the two counts are multiplied.  For example: "2d3w"
		  deletes six words.
		- The motion can be backwards, e.g. "db" to delete to the
		  start of the word.
		- The motion can also be a mouse click.  The mouse is not
		  supported in every terminal though.
		- The ":omap" command can be used to map characters while an
		  operator is pending.
		- Ex commands can be used to move the cursor.  This can be
		  used to call a function that does some complicated motion.
		  The motion is always characterwise exclusive, no matter
		  what ":" command is used.  This means it's impossible to
		  include the last character of a line without the line break
		  (unless 'virtualedit' is set).
		  If the Ex command changes the text before where the operator
		  starts or jumps to another buffer the result is
		  unpredictable.  It is possible to change the text further
		  down.  Jumping to another buffer is possible if the current
		  buffer is not unloaded.

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="{Visual}">{Visual}</a>*</b>
<code class="special">{Visual}</code>	A selected text area.  It is started with the "v", "V", or
		<code class="keystroke">CTRL-V</code> command, then any cursor movement command can be used
		to change the end of the selected text.
		This is used before an |<a href="motion.html#operator">operator</a>| command to highlight the
		text that is to be operated upon.
		See |<a href="visual.html#Visual-mode">Visual-mode</a>|.

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="%3Ccharacter%3E">&lt;character&gt;</a>*</b>
<code class="special">&lt;character&gt;</code>	A special character from the table below, optionally with
		modifiers, or a single ASCII character with modifiers.

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="'character'">'character'</a>*</b>
'c'		A single ASCII character.

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="CTRL-{char}">CTRL-{char}</a>*</b>
CTRL-<code class="special">{char}</code>	<code class="special">{char}</code> typed as a control character; that is, typing <code class="special">{char}</code>
		while holding the CTRL key down.  The case of <code class="special">{char}</code> does not
		matter; thus <code class="keystroke">CTRL-A</code> and <code class="keystroke">CTRL-a</code> are equivalent.  But on some
		terminals, using the SHIFT key will produce another code,
		don't use it then.

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="'option'">'option'</a>*</b>
'option'	An option, or parameter, that can be set to a value, is
		enclosed in single quotes.  See |<a href="options.html#options">options</a>|.

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="quotecommandquote">quotecommandquote</a>*</b>
"command"	A reference to a command that you can type is enclosed in
		double quotes.
`command`	New style command, this distinguishes it from other quoted
		text and strings.

					<b class="vimtag">*<a name="key-notation">key-notation</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="key-codes">key-codes</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="keycodes">keycodes</a>*</b>
These names for keys are used in the documentation.  They can also be used
with the ":map" command (insert the key name by pressing <code class="keystroke">CTRL-K</code> and then the
key you want the name for).

</pre><hr/><pre>
<code class="note">Note:</code> The shifted cursor keys, the help key, and the undo key are only
available on a few terminals.  On the Amiga, shifted function key 10 produces
a code (CSI) that is also used by key sequences.  It will be recognized only
after typing another key.

<code class="note">Note:</code> There are two codes for the delete key.  127 is the decimal ASCII value
for the delete key, which is always recognized.  Some delete keys send another
value, in which case this value is obtained from the termcap entry "kD".  Both
values have the same effect.  Also see |<a href="options.html#:fixdel">:fixdel</a>|.

<code class="note">Note:</code> The keypad keys are used in the same way as the corresponding "normal"
keys.  For example, <code class="special">&lt;kHome&gt;</code> has the same effect as <code class="special">&lt;Home&gt;</code>.  If a keypad key
sends the same raw key code as its non-keypad equivalent, it will be
recognized as the non-keypad code.  For example, when <code class="special">&lt;kHome&gt;</code> sends the same
code as <code class="special">&lt;Home&gt;</code>, when pressing <code class="special">&lt;kHome&gt;</code> Vim will think <code class="special">&lt;Home&gt;</code> was pressed.
Mapping <code class="special">&lt;kHome&gt;</code> will not work then.

								<b class="vimtag">*<a name="%3C%3E">&lt;&gt;</a>*</b>
Examples are often given in the <code class="special">&lt;&gt;</code> notation.  Sometimes this is just to make
clear what you need to type, but often it can be typed literally, e.g., with
the ":map" command.  The rules are:
 1.  Any printable characters are typed directly, except backslash and '&lt;'
 2.  A backslash is represented with "\\", double backslash, or "<code class="special">&lt;Bslash&gt;</code>".
 3.  A real '<code class="special">&lt;' is represented with "\&lt;" or "&lt;lt&gt;</code>".  When there is no
     confusion possible, a '&lt;' can be used directly.
 4.  "<code class="special">&lt;key&gt;</code>" means the special key typed.  This is the notation explained in
     the table above.  A few examples:
	   <code class="special">&lt;Esc&gt;</code>		Escape key
	   <code class="special">&lt;C-G&gt;</code>		<code class="keystroke">CTRL-G</code>
	   <code class="special">&lt;Up&gt;</code>			cursor up key
	   <code class="special">&lt;C-LeftMouse&gt;</code>	Control- left mouse click
	   <code class="special">&lt;S-F11&gt;</code>		Shifted function key 11
	   <code class="special">&lt;M-a&gt;</code>		Meta- a  ('a' with bit 8 set)
	   <code class="special">&lt;M-A&gt;</code>		Meta- A  ('A' with bit 8 set)
	   <code class="special">&lt;t_kd&gt;</code>		"kd" termcap entry (cursor down key)
    Although you can specify <code class="special">&lt;M-<code class="special">{char}</code>&gt;</code> with <code class="special">{char}</code> being a multi-byte
    character, Vim may not be able to know what byte sequence that is and then
    it won't work.

If you want to use the full <code class="special">&lt;&gt;</code> notation in Vim, you have to make sure the '&lt;'
flag is excluded from 'cpoptions' (when 'compatible' is not set, it already is
by default).
<code class="example">	:set cpo-=&lt;</code>
The <code class="special">&lt;&gt;</code> notation uses <code class="special">&lt;lt&gt;</code> to escape the special meaning of key names.  Using a
backslash also works, but only when 'cpoptions' does not include the 'B' flag.

Examples for mapping <code class="keystroke">CTRL-H</code> to the six characters "<code class="special">&lt;Home&gt;</code>":
<code class="example">	:imap <code class="special">&lt;C-H&gt;</code> \<code class="special">&lt;Home&gt;</code></code>
<code class="example">	:imap <code class="special">&lt;C-H&gt;</code> <code class="special">&lt;lt&gt;</code>Home&gt;</code>
The first one only works when the 'B' flag is not in 'cpoptions'.  The second
one always works.
To get a literal "<code class="special">&lt;lt&gt;</code>" in a mapping:
<code class="example">	:map <code class="special">&lt;C-L&gt;</code> <code class="special">&lt;lt&gt;</code>lt&gt;</code>
<code class="example"></code>
For mapping, abbreviation and menu commands you can then copy-paste the
examples and use them directly.  Or type them literally, including the '&lt;' and
'&gt;' characters.  This does NOT work for other commands, like ":set" and
":autocmd"!

</pre><hr/><pre>5. Modes, introduction				<b class="vimtag">*<a name="vim-modes-intro">vim-modes-intro</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="vim-modes">vim-modes</a>*</b>

Vim has seven BASIC modes:

					<b class="vimtag">*<a name="Normal">Normal</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="Normal-mode">Normal-mode</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="command-mode">command-mode</a>*</b>
Normal mode		In Normal mode you can enter all the normal editor
			commands.  If you start the editor you are in this
			mode (unless you have set the 'insertmode' option,
			see below).  This is also known as command mode.

Visual mode		This is like Normal mode, but the movement commands
			extend a highlighted area.  When a non-movement
			command is used, it is executed for the highlighted
			area.  See |<a href="visual.html#Visual-mode">Visual-mode</a>|.
			If the 'showmode' option is on "-- VISUAL --" is shown
			at the bottom of the window.

Select mode		This looks most like the MS-Windows selection mode.
			Typing a printable character deletes the selection
			and starts Insert mode.  See |<a href="visual.html#Select-mode">Select-mode</a>|.
			If the 'showmode' option is on "-- SELECT --" is shown
			at the bottom of the window.

Insert mode		In Insert mode the text you type is inserted into the
			buffer.  See |<a href="insert.html#Insert-mode">Insert-mode</a>|.
			If the 'showmode' option is on "-- INSERT --" is shown
			at the bottom of the window.

Command-line mode	In Command-line mode (also called Cmdline mode) you
Cmdline mode		can enter one line of text at the bottom of the
			window.  This is for the Ex commands, ":", the pattern
			search commands, "?" and "/", and the filter command,
			"!".  |<a href="cmdline.html#Cmdline-mode">Cmdline-mode</a>|

Ex mode			Like Command-line mode, but after entering a command
			you remain in Ex mode.  Very limited editing of the
			command line.  |<a href="intro.html#Ex-mode">Ex-mode</a>|

Terminal-Job mode	Interacting with a job in a terminal window.  Typed
			keys go to the job and the job output is displayed in
			the terminal window.  See |<a href="terminal.html#terminal">terminal</a>| about how to
			switch to other modes.

There are seven ADDITIONAL modes.  These are variants of the BASIC modes:

				<b class="vimtag">*<a name="Operator-pending">Operator-pending</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="Operator-pending-mode">Operator-pending-mode</a>*</b>
Operator-pending mode	This is like Normal mode, but after an operator
			command has started, and Vim is waiting for a <code class="special">{motion}</code>
			to specify the text that the operator will work on.

Replace mode		Replace mode is a special case of Insert mode.  You
			can do the same things as in Insert mode, but for
			each character you enter, one character of the existing
			text is deleted.  See |<a href="insert.html#Replace-mode">Replace-mode</a>|.
			If the 'showmode' option is on "-- REPLACE --" is
			shown at the bottom of the window.

Virtual Replace mode	Virtual Replace mode is similar to Replace mode, but
			instead of file characters you are replacing screen
			real estate.  See |<a href="insert.html#Virtual-Replace-mode">Virtual-Replace-mode</a>|.
			If the 'showmode' option is on "-- VREPLACE --" is
			shown at the bottom of the window.

Insert Normal mode	Entered when <code class="keystroke">CTRL-O</code> is typed in Insert mode (see
			|<a href="insert.html#i_CTRL-O">i_CTRL-O</a>|).  This is like Normal mode, but after
			executing one command Vim returns to Insert mode.
			If the 'showmode' option is on "-- (insert) --" is
			shown at the bottom of the window.

Terminal-Normal mode	Using Normal mode in a terminal window.  Making
			changes is impossible.  Use an insert command, such as
			"a" or "i", to return to Terminal-Job mode.

Insert Visual mode	Entered when starting a Visual selection from Insert
			mode, e.g., by using <code class="keystroke">CTRL-O</code> and then "v", "V" or
			<code class="keystroke">CTRL-V</code>.  When the Visual selection ends, Vim returns
			to Insert mode.
			If the 'showmode' option is on "-- (insert) VISUAL --"
			is shown at the bottom of the window.

Insert Select mode	Entered when starting Select mode from Insert mode.
			E.g., by dragging the mouse or <code class="special">&lt;S-Right&gt;</code>.
			When the Select mode ends, Vim returns to Insert mode.
			If the 'showmode' option is on "-- (insert) SELECT --"
			is shown at the bottom of the window.

</pre><hr/><pre>6. Switching from mode to mode				<b class="vimtag">*<a name="mode-switching">mode-switching</a>*</b>

If for any reason you do not know which mode you are in, you can always get
back to Normal mode by typing <code class="special">&lt;Esc&gt;</code> twice.  This doesn't work for Ex mode
though, use ":visual".
You will know you are back in Normal mode when you see the screen flash or
hear the bell after you type <code class="special">&lt;Esc&gt;</code>.  However, when pressing <code class="special">&lt;Esc&gt;</code> after using
<code class="keystroke">CTRL-O</code> in Insert mode you get a beep but you are still in Insert mode, type
<code class="special">&lt;Esc&gt;</code> again.

-- not possible

*1 Go from Normal mode to Insert mode by giving the command "i", "I", "a",
   "A", "o", "O", "c", "C", "s" or S".
*2 Go from Visual mode to Normal mode by giving a non-movement command, which
   causes the command to be executed, or by hitting <code class="special">&lt;Esc&gt;</code> "v", "V" or "<code class="keystroke">CTRL-V</code>"
   (see |<a href="visual.html#v_v">v_v</a>|), which just stops Visual mode without side effects.
*3 Go from Command-line mode to Normal mode by:
   - Hitting <code class="special">&lt;CR&gt;</code> or <code class="special">&lt;NL&gt;</code>, which causes the entered command to be executed.
   - Deleting the complete line (e.g., with <code class="keystroke">CTRL-U</code>) and giving a final <code class="special">&lt;BS&gt;</code>.
   - Hitting <code class="keystroke">CTRL-C</code> or <code class="special">&lt;Esc&gt;</code>, which quits the command-line without executing
     the command.
   In the last case <code class="special">&lt;Esc&gt;</code> may be the character defined with the 'wildchar'
   option, in which case it will start command-line completion.  You can
   ignore that and type <code class="special">&lt;Esc&gt;</code> again.
*4 Go from Normal to Select mode by:
   - use the mouse to select text while 'selectmode' contains "mouse"
   - use a non-printable command to move the cursor while keeping the Shift
     key pressed, and the 'selectmode' option contains "key"
   - use "v", "V" or "<code class="keystroke">CTRL-V</code>" while 'selectmode' contains "cmd"
   - use "gh", "gH" or "g <code class="keystroke">CTRL-H</code>"  |<a href="visual.html#g_CTRL-H">g_CTRL-H</a>|
*5 Go from Select mode to Normal mode by using a non-printable command to move
   the cursor, without keeping the Shift key pressed.
*6 Go from Select mode to Insert mode by typing a printable character.  The
   selection is deleted and the character is inserted.

If the 'insertmode' option is on, editing a file will start in Insert mode.

	<b class="vimtag">*<a name="CTRL-\_CTRL-N">CTRL-\_CTRL-N</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="i_CTRL-\_CTRL-N">i_CTRL-\_CTRL-N</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="c_CTRL-\_CTRL-N">c_CTRL-\_CTRL-N</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="v_CTRL-\_CTRL-N">v_CTRL-\_CTRL-N</a>*</b>
Additionally the command CTRL-\ <code class="keystroke">CTRL-N</code> or <code class="special">&lt;C-\&gt;</code><code class="special">&lt;C-N&gt;</code> can be used to go to
Normal mode from any other mode.  This can be used to make sure Vim is in
Normal mode, without causing a beep like <code class="special">&lt;Esc&gt;</code> would.  However, this does not
work in Ex mode.  When used after a command that takes an argument, such as
|<a href="motion.html#f">f</a>| or |<a href="motion.html#m">m</a>|, the timeout set with 'ttimeoutlen' applies.
When focus is in a terminal window, CTRL-\ <code class="keystroke">CTRL-N</code> goes to Normal mode for only
one command, see |<a href="terminal.html#t_CTRL-\_CTRL-N">t_CTRL-\_CTRL-N</a>|.

	<b class="vimtag">*<a name="CTRL-\_CTRL-G">CTRL-\_CTRL-G</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="i_CTRL-\_CTRL-G">i_CTRL-\_CTRL-G</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="c_CTRL-\_CTRL-G">c_CTRL-\_CTRL-G</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="v_CTRL-\_CTRL-G">v_CTRL-\_CTRL-G</a>*</b>
The command CTRL-\ <code class="keystroke">CTRL-G</code> or <code class="special">&lt;C-\&gt;</code><code class="special">&lt;C-G&gt;</code> can be used to go to Insert mode when
'insertmode' is set.  Otherwise it goes to Normal mode.  This can be used to
make sure Vim is in the mode indicated by 'insertmode', without knowing in
what mode Vim currently is.

				    <b class="vimtag">*<a name="Q">Q</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="mode-Ex">mode-Ex</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="Ex-mode">Ex-mode</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="Ex">Ex</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="EX">EX</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="E501">E501</a>*</b>
Q			Switch to "Ex" mode.  This is a bit like typing ":"
			commands one after another, except:
			- You don't have to keep pressing ":".
			- The screen doesn't get updated after each command.
			- There is no normal command-line editing.
			- Mappings and abbreviations are not used.
			In fact, you are editing the lines with the "standard"
			line-input editing commands (<code class="special">&lt;Del&gt;</code> or <code class="special">&lt;BS&gt;</code> to erase,
			<code class="keystroke">CTRL-U</code> to kill the whole line).
			Vim will enter this mode by default if it's invoked as
			"ex" on the command-line.
			Use the ":vi" command |<a href="editing.html#:visual">:visual</a>| to exit "Ex" mode.
			<code class="note">Note:</code> In older versions of Vim "Q" formatted text,
			that is now done with |<a href="change.html#gq">gq</a>|.  But if you use the
			|<a href="usr_05.html#vimrc_example.vim">vimrc_example.vim</a>| script "Q" works like "gq".

					<b class="vimtag">*<a name="gQ">gQ</a>*</b>
gQ			Switch to "Ex" mode like with "Q", but really behave
			like typing ":" commands after another.  All command
			line editing, completion etc. is available.
			Use the ":vi" command |<a href="editing.html#:visual">:visual</a>| to exit "Ex" mode.

</pre><hr/><pre>7. The window contents					<b class="vimtag">*<a name="window-contents">window-contents</a>*</b>

In Normal mode and Insert/Replace mode the screen window will show the current
contents of the buffer: What You See Is What You Get.  There are two
exceptions:
- When the 'cpoptions' option contains '$', and the change is within one line,
  the text is not directly deleted, but a '$' is put at the last deleted
  character.
- When inserting text in one window, other windows on the same text are not
  updated until the insert is finished.

Lines longer than the window width will wrap, unless the 'wrap' option is off
(see below).  The 'linebreak' option can be set to wrap at a blank character.

If the window has room after the last line of the buffer, Vim will show '~' in
the first column of the last lines in the window, like this:

	+-----------------------+
	|<code class="badlink">some line		</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">last line		</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">~			</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">~			</code>|
	+-----------------------+

Thus the '~' lines indicate that the end of the buffer was reached.

If the last line in a window doesn't fit, Vim will indicate this with a '@' in
the first column of the last lines in the window, like this:

	+-----------------------+
	|<code class="badlink">first line		</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">second line		</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">@			</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">@			</code>|
	+-----------------------+

Thus the '@' lines indicate that there is a line that doesn't fit in the
window.

When the "lastline" flag is present in the 'display' option, you will not see
'@' characters at the left side of window.  If the last line doesn't fit
completely, only the part that fits is shown, and the last three characters of
the last line are replaced with "@@@", like this:

	+-----------------------+
	|<code class="badlink">first line		</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">second line		</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">a very long line that d</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">oesn't fit in the wi@@@</code>|
	+-----------------------+

If there is a single line that is too long to fit in the window, this is a
special situation.  Vim will show only part of the line, around where the
cursor is.  There are no special characters shown, so that you can edit all
parts of this line.

The '@' occasion in the 'highlight' option can be used to set special
highlighting for the '@' and '~' characters.  This makes it possible to
distinguish them from real characters in the buffer.

The 'showbreak' option contains the string to put in front of wrapped lines.

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="wrap-off">wrap-off</a>*</b>
If the 'wrap' option is off, long lines will not wrap.  Only the part that
fits on the screen is shown.  If the cursor is moved to a part of the line
that is not shown, the screen is scrolled horizontally.  The advantage of
this method is that columns are shown as they are and lines that cannot fit
on the screen can be edited.  The disadvantage is that you cannot see all the
characters of a line at once.  The 'sidescroll' option can be set to the
minimal number of columns to scroll.

All normal ASCII characters are displayed directly on the screen.  The <code class="special">&lt;Tab&gt;</code>
is replaced with the number of spaces that it represents.  Other non-printing
characters are replaced with "^<code class="special">{char}</code>", where <code class="special">{char}</code> is the non-printing
character with 64 added.  Thus character 7 (bell) will be shown as "^G".
Characters between 127 and 160 are replaced with "~<code class="special">{char}</code>", where <code class="special">{char}</code> is
the character with 64 subtracted.  These characters occupy more than one
position on the screen.  The cursor can only be positioned on the first one.

If you set the 'number' option, all lines will be preceded with their
number.  Tip: If you don't like wrapping lines to mix with the line numbers,
set the 'showbreak' option to eight spaces:
	":set showbreak=\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ "

If you set the 'list' option, <code class="special">&lt;Tab&gt;</code> characters will not be shown as several
spaces, but as "^I".  A '$' will be placed at the end of the line, so you can
find trailing blanks.

In Command-line mode only the command-line itself is shown correctly.  The
display of the buffer contents is updated as soon as you go back to Command
mode.

The last line of the window is used for status and other messages.  The
status messages will only be used if an option is on:

<code class="section">status message			option	     default	Unix default	</code>
current mode			'showmode'	on	    on
command characters		'showcmd'	on	    off
cursor position			'ruler'		off	    off

The current mode is "-- INSERT --" or "-- REPLACE --", see |<a href="options.html#'showmode'">'showmode'</a>|.  The
command characters are those that you typed but were not used yet.

If you have a slow terminal you can switch off the status messages to speed
up editing:
	:set nosc noru nosm

If there is an error, an error message will be shown for at least one second
(in reverse video).

Some commands show how many lines were affected.  Above which threshold this
happens can be controlled with the 'report' option (default 2).

On the Amiga Vim will run in a CLI window.  The name Vim and the full name of
the current file name will be shown in the title bar.  When the window is
resized, Vim will automatically redraw the window.  You may make the window as
small as you like, but if it gets too small not a single line will fit in it.
Make it at least 40 characters wide to be able to read most messages on the
last line.

On most Unix systems, resizing the window is recognized and handled correctly
by Vim.

  buffer		Contains lines of text, usually read from a file.
  screen		The whole area that Vim uses to work in.  This can be
			a terminal emulator window.  Also called "the Vim
			window".
  window		A view on a buffer.  There can be multiple windows for
			one buffer.

A screen contains one or more windows, separated by status lines and with the
command line at the bottom.

	+-------------------------------+
screen	|<code class="badlink"> window 1	</code>| window 2	|
	|<code class="badlink">		</code>|		|
	|<code class="badlink">		</code>|		|
	|<code class="badlink">= status line =</code>|= status line =|
	|<code class="badlink"> window 3			</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">				</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">				</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">==== status line ==============</code>|
	|<code class="badlink">command line			</code>|
	+-------------------------------+

The command line is also used for messages.  It scrolls up the screen when
there is not enough room in the command line.

A difference is made between four types of lines:

  buffer lines		The lines in the buffer.  This is the same as the
			lines as they are read from/written to a file.  They
			can be thousands of characters long.
  logical lines		The buffer lines with folding applied.  Buffer lines
			in a closed fold are changed to a single logical line:
			"+-- 99 lines folded".  They can be thousands of
			characters long.
  window lines		The lines displayed in a window: A range of logical
			lines with wrapping, line breaks, etc.  applied.  They
			can only be as long as the width of the window allows,
			longer lines are wrapped or truncated.
  screen lines		The lines of the screen that Vim uses.  Consists of
			the window lines of all windows, with status lines
			and the command line added.  They can only be as long
			as the width of the screen allows.  When the command
			line gets longer it wraps and lines are scrolled to
			make room.
